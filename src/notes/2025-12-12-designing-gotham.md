Doug Wilson interviewed Tobias Frere-Jones on [designing Gotham](https://frerejones.com/blog/designing-gotham):

<blockquote>
<p>Trying to write about Gotham as we approach the 25th anniversary of its release feels like trying to write about air: yes, it is made up of nitrogen, oxygen, and carbon dioxide, but that isn’t really why air is helpful or important.</p>

<p>What I can confidently say is this: seeing it first used to great success in the pages of GQ magazine in 2001, then chosen for the cornerstone of One World Trade Center in 2004, and then picked for the 2008 Obama presidential campaign made sure Gotham was seen practically everywhere. If you were a designer choosing a typeface in the first decade of the 2000s, Gotham was on your short list; if not the only typeface on your list.</p>

A lot of great stuff in this post, particulary the photographs of the source material: vernacular signage in New York City.

Earlier this year, [Mark Simonson wrote a post celebrating the 20th birthday of his Proxima Nova](https://www.marksimonson.com/notebook/view/proxima-nova-turns-20/). Frere-Jones doesn't mention Proxima, while Simonson does mention Gotham. The graphic designer (me) who has used both of these designs a lot in his first decades of working appreciates hearing from both type designers, looking back on these blockbuster releases.
