<p>Writing HTML is often simpler and easier to remember than the markdown equivalent.</p>

<p>This rings true. I can never remember the syntaxt for an image and its alt text in markdown, and there's often more I want to include anyway in HTML. HTML is also wonderfully nuanced: You can italicize things quickly in Markdown, but it will always use <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> (emphasis), when you might need <code>&lt;cite&gt;</code> for a title of a book or something, or <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> for <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/i">idiomatic text</a>. </p>
