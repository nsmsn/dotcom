<blockquote>
<p><i>Strangers, By Spring</i> is a writing project, but it's also an independent web project. It's part of the practice of an ongoing effort to make things simply because <em>you want them in the world</em>. The process is the reward, and anything beyond that, less important. We'd both really love to encourage you to make many, many more of the things that <em>you</em> want to see, too.</p>
