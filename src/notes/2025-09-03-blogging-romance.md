> Not having comments is not somehow anti-communitarian, because any given blogger is always and forever entirely free to write a response _on their own blog_. One could argue, although I won’t (well, maybe a little bit), that this is _more_ community-minded than trying to silo comments upon your posts into a section of your own website.
