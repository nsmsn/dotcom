Brandon, on [forming communities](https://krrd.ing/forming-communities/): 

> When we are conditioned towards exclusion, we need to specifically work towards **inclusion**. Anyone or any class that is actively being dehumanized - we've got to choose inclusion and welcome regardless of fear. Rather than except the dehumanization we should work to re-humanize and hold space for people.
