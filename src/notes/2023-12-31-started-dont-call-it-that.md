Started reading _[Don't Call It That](https://nopicnicpress.com/shop/dont-call-it-that): A Naming Workbook_ by Eli Altman, ISBN: 9781734248302 ðŸ“š

Got this as a gift recently. It goes into the naming and branding process at [A Hundred Monkeys](https://www.ahundredmonkeys.com/) and is full of idea-generating activities.

One thing Altman doesn't recommend is starting with domain names, or at least giving up if the dot-com is not available. His reasoning is that there are a lot of creative work-arounds, audiences are getting more web-savvy, and your target audience isn't likely to give up on you if your business or product isn't at a predictable web address.

Good stuff so far.
