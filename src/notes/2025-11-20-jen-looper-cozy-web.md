In her talk for [PixelPalooza 2025](https://cfe.dev/events/pixelpalooza-2025/) today, [Jen Looper](https://www.jenlooper.com/) shared her thoughts on the personal web in the age of AI, referencing Proust, the [Dark Forest and the Cozy Web](https://maggieappleton.com/cozy-web), online communities and inclusion, [Useless Websites](https://theuselessweb.com/), and a ton more.

One of Jen's slides:

<blockquote>

<p><strong>We find ourselves in a Proustian moment</strong>:</p>
<p>Many of us built our careers alongside the rise of the internet and we are witnessing profound change in what the internet signifies.</p>
<p>Do you ever have nostalgia about those moments? What triggers it?</p>
<p>Should we take steps to reclaim what we invented?</p>
</blockquote>

I'm eager to re-watch this talk!
