<a href="https://www.equator.org/"><i>Equator</i></a> is a brand new magazine, focused on politics, culture, and art.

<blockquote>
<p>The theme that unites our first stories is the passing of a grand illusion: the illusion that the whole world was on a trajectory, however delayed or disrupted, toward Western modernity. That history had a direction – and America stood at its terminus, beckoning others forward.</p>

<p>This illusion was never entirely believed, even by those who professed it most loudly. But it shaped the desires and aspirations of people everywhere; it constrained what could be imagined, demanded and built.</p>

<p>Today, the American model persists, but in a diminished form – as merely one option among others, and no longer inevitable. And this shift, from destiny to choice, from universal to particular, marks the true end of the illusion. What remains is not collapse but something far stranger.</p>

<p>The launch of <i>Equator</i> explores many facets of this transformation – how it feels, what it means, where it leads. Together, they map a world learning to imagine itself beyond the coordinates that once seemed permanent. This is where we begin.</p>

I've been anticipating the launch of this new publication, and there are pieces in here I'm eager to read. I wish I could subscribe to this with RSS, because so far the login-with-email experience (powered by Shopify, of all things) leaves a bit to be desired.
