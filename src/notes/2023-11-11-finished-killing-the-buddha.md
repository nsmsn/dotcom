Finished reading _[Killing the Buddha: A Heretic's Bible by Peter Manseau and Jeff Sharlet](https://bookshop.org/a/21729/9780743232777)_. ðŸ“š

ISBN: 9780743232777

Twenty-plus years ago, Peter Manseau and Jeff Sharlet set out on a road trip to chronicle the spiritual side of this weird landmass called the United States. They join a gathering of pagans in Kansas, meet the pastor of a cowboy church in Texas, interview a storm chaser in Oklahoma, you get the idea.

Interspersed between each travelogue entry is short fiction or nonfiction inspired by the Old Testament, plus "Gospel" and "Revelation" by a variety of contemporary authors. "Samuel" follows the rise and fall of a preacher in a church tightly controlled by twelve deacons. "Job" is a meditation on suffering with a few jokes and Venn diagrams. The short story "Gospel" appropriately has 4 different endings.

A mixed bag, but intriguing and entertaining enough to keep me from beginning to end.
