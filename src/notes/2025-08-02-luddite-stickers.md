I got some fun laptop stickers printed recently. The design is heavily influenced by <a href="/posts/2024-call-me-a-luddite.html">my reading of <i>Blood in the Machine</i> by Brian Merchant</a>. 

I am selling these in my ko-fi shop in [packs of two](https://ko-fi.com/s/7ff96b0a15) (one for you, one for a friend) for $6 USD and [4-packs for $10 USD](https://ko-fi.com/s/871275c3cc) (so you can start a revolution). I'm not looking to make a ton of money from these; I just want to get them out there in the real world. I will start mailing orders early next week.

The stickers themselves are red ink on a glossy mirror-like surface, which I think looks cool, but are hard to photograph. Depending on how these do, I may re-order more, but will probably skip the mirror effect for the second printing.
