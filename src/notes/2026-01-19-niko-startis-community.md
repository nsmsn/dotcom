I recently finished reading <cite>The Dad Rock That Made Me a Woman</cite>, a memoir in essays by Niko Stratis. A good book, particularly if you are someone who thinks about recorded music/popular music a lot. The author gave [an interview with Xtra magazine](https://xtramagazine.com/culture/books/niko-stratis-dad-rock-273485) about the book on its release last year. I have been thinking about this excerpt from that interview, in which she's responding to a question on masculinity:

> Men don’t have to think about community a lot, right? Because every community they feel belongs to them. And I think that is a damaging thing. Men need to start to consider the spaces that they’re in a lot more and be thinking, “Whose community is this and how do I honour that; how do I help preserve it; how do I help look after it in a way that doesn’t centre me?”
