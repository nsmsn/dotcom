I had an interesting chat with [Pete Millspaugh](https://www.petemillspaugh.com/) about domain names yesterday. Pete reached out to me after reading my recent [People and Blogs interview](https://manuelmoreale.com/pb-nick-simson).

Why domain names? Pete's writing a book called [dot com et al: The secret life of Internet domains](https://www.dotcom.press/). If that topic intrigues you, you may want to check out the [email newsletter](https://www.dotcom.press/archive) for the book, and consider signing up.
