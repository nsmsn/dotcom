Started reading [Free Speech: A History from Socrates to Social Media](https://micro.blog/books/9781541600492) by Jacob Mchangama 📚

Reading this along with a few of my co-workers this summer. The author will be speaking at our org's annual meeting later this year. [LA Review of Books has a good review](https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/the-endless-struggle-between-censorship-and-free-speech/).
