[Ethan Marcotte, on the U.S. National Design Studio executive order](https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/a-notional-design-studio/):

> I don’t think it’s an accident that a simple-looking “America by Design” page is built the way it is. It’s communicating their priorities, and how this government wants to redefine design. This “national studio” is designing for the small subset of American citizens who fit their ideal of who can afford, and who can access, the digital services they’ll create.

I also appreciated this parody, with a lot of legitimate questions about what the initiative is: [americabydesign.fail](https://americabydesign.fail/).
