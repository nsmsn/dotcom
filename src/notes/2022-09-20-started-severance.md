Started reading: [Severance](https://bookshop.org/a/21729/9781250214997) by Ling Ma ðŸ“š

Digging into this contemporary apocalyptic zombie novel about a mysterious pathogen and a small group of survivors. The book features a project manager as the protagonist: a millennial woman who works for a bible manufacturer facing down a plague of biblical proportions.

This book predates the Covid-19 pandemic by only two years.
