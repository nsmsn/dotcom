I stumbled upon [Chris Glass' website](https://chrisglass.com/), which has been around for a long time, but still new to me. Notably, Chris designed the [Recovery.gov emblem](https://chrisglass.com/projects/american-recovery-reinvestment-act-emblem/) you saw everywhere around the U.S. in the early 2010s. 

Chris has a page at [/characters](https://chrisglass.com/characters/) showcasing the folks he's featured in his daily photo journal. I've seen tagging pictures with people on big platforms like [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/help/227499947267037/) and [Flickr](https://blog.flickr.net/en/2009/10/21/people-in-photos/) in the past, but this is something I seldom see on blogs and personal websites. I've been [tagging Places](/tags/places.html) in my own online notebook, but I never thought to tag the "characters" in my own life. Out of respect for privacy, mostly, I don't publish a lot of the images of friends and families I capture. I'm also nowhere nearly as good at photographing people as Chris.

Chris' Characters/Folks page also features a nice [promise to add more](https://chrisglass.com/characters/there-will-be-more-characters/) to these pages.
