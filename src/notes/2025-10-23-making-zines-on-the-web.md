I've been seeing a couple of HTML + CSS zine layouts making the rounds online recently. Chip Wasson published a [Zine HTML Layout](https://futurama.io/zine-layout/) on his blog. [Benji](https://www.benji.dog/) shared with me the [Zine Machine](https://rowan.fyi/made/zine-machine/) made by [Rowan](https://rowan.fyi/). Both of these examples use CSS grid, which is great, and I particularly like how the Zine Machine example features the folding and cutting instructions.

Ben Brown is [bookmarking zine instructions and resources](https://bookmarks.benbrown.com/tagged/zines) of all kinds on his website, too.
