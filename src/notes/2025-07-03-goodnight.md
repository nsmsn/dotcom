One of the great moments of each day with our three-year-old is the bedtime routine. After one of us says "goodnight" she always replies with a cheerful "Goodnight! See ya at breakfast!"

Every single night.

I'm not sure why, but I think it's the funniest thing in the world. I am going to miss this when she stops saying it.
