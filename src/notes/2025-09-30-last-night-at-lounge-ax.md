I signed up to back [Last Night at Lounge Ax](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/lvngmntn/last-night-at-lounge-ax-a-documentary-film/description), a documentary film project on Kickstarter.

> Opened in 1987, Lounge Ax was a legendary indie venue owned and operated by two women in a scene dominated by men. Susan and Julia created a Midwest haven for touring bandsâ€”no frills, no corporate backing, just a true love for music and the people who make it.

I never visited Lounge Ax (the club closed in 2000 when I was 13), but I still want to see this film! The Chicago scene looms large in my musical imagination, and this film captures the last three nights of a famed venue. Some of the featured performances include Shellac, Jim O'Rourke, and Bonnie 'Prince' Billy.
