The next thing I may do to expand [Typo.town](https://typo.town) is to start a collection of free fonts that aren't on Google Fonts. Here's three more sans serifs I've come across recently I would include in that list: 

- [Apfel Grotezk](https://www.collletttivo.it/typefaces/apfel-grotezk) by Collletttivo
- [Lil Sans](https://noirblancrouge.com/fonts/lil-grotesk/) by Noir Blanc Rogue
- [Orbit](https://maxenceduterne.com/orbit) by Maxence Duterne

None of these typefaces feature italics or obliques. Orbit is only available in one weight. All are pretty unique and quirky enough I would use them in future projects, maybe as display type.
