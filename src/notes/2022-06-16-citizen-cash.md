Finished reading: [Citizen Cash: The Political Life and Times of Johnny Cash](https://bookshop.org/a/21729/9781541699571) by Michael Stewart Foley ðŸ“š

I enjoyed this book, particularly the chapter on Cashâ€™s prison concerts and about his opposition to the death penalty and activism for prison reform. The epilogue, on the American recordings (produced by Rick Rubin) and the end of Cashâ€™s life around the beginning of the Iraq war, was also quite good.
