<p>I don't think Bluesky and I were ever a good fit, but as it turns out I do follow a bunch of people who are only on <a href="https://atproto.com/guides/overview">atproto</a>. Blacksky runs a couple <a href="https://atproto.com/guides/glossary#pds-personal-data-server">Personal Data Servers (PDSs)</a> in addition to their flagship <code>blacksky.app</code> PDS.</p>

<p>I'm going to suspend my own use of Bluesky until I properly migrate my account to somewhere else. I think that means I'll be chipping in to an Open Collective, whereas I haven't given Bluesky a single cent. Turning off Openvibe, Crucial Tracks, and EchoFeed for now.</p>
