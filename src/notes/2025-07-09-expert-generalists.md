<blockquote>
<p>Why does our attention keep drifting toward tool expertise? It isn't because people are shortsighted or lazy; it's because the fundamentals are hard to see amid the noise. Key ideas hide under stacks of product docs, YouTube tutorials, vendor blogs, and conference talks. At one end of the spectrum lie dense academic papers and university courses; at the other, vendor certifications tied to a single product. Connecting these dots — cutting through the surface to reach the essentials — takes deliberate effort. One proven aid is the language of patterns: reusable problem-solution pairs that capture the core principle without the brand labels. That's why we belive in investing in exploring, distilling, and sharing such patterns — so the industry conversation can shift from “Which tool should I learn next?” to “Which underlying principles and patterns must I master?” </p>
