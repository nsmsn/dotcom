Eleanor brought home an April issue of _The Atlantic_ from the library, which featured an excellent story called "[The Girls of Summer](https://archive.is/FIE7c)" by Kaitlyn Tiffany. For this story, Tiffany traveled to Florida to attend the Yankees Women's Mini-Fantasy Camp, and recounts a history of women being excluded from baseball. The Yankees and Red Sox are the only MLB teams that offered a fantasy camp for women, but more teams ([including the Mets](https://www.mlb.com/mets/fans/fantasy-camp/womens)) will offer similar experiences for fans in 2026.

Tiffany also [covered the Women's Professional Baseball League tryouts in August](https://archive.is/ZKvl8), ahead of a draft that will take place in October for a new league making its debut in 2026:

> This will be the first of its kind since the dissolution of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball Leagueâ€”a wartime entertainment that gave hundreds of women the opportunity to play baseball in front of paying fans, but which fell apart in the early 1950s due to mismanagement and dwindling attendance.

It will also be the first _integrated_ league for professional women's baseball. Also notable: the players will hit with metal bats, the pitchers will bat and run bases, and there will be more curveballs. Although the first season will be remarkably short compared to the MLB's 162 games, I'm excited to see this historic chapter for baseball to unfold, and eager to attend one of these games with my daughter someday.
