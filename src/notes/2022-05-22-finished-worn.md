Finished reading: [Worn: A People’s History of Clothing](https://micro.blog/books/9781524748401) by Sofi Thanhauser 📚

Fascinating global examination of the social and labor history of clothing production, told through five fabrics: Linen, Cotton, Silk, Synthetics, and Wool.

In many ways this could have been a much more expansive book—This is not an anthropological look at the meaning of clothing or history of fashion as status marker. Still, I thought it was a great read (or in my case audiobook) for what it is.
