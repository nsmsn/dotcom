Hamilton Nolan, on why [the country that starts the war is wrong](https://www.hamiltonnolan.com/p/the-country-that-starts-the-war-is):

> Opening the door to things like “preemptive wars” to head off some form of (real or concocted) threat has the same effect as saying it is okay to shoot someone if they make you nervous. It causes a lot of people to get shot unnecessarily. As a rule, it produces more bad consequences than good. The judge will explain this to you when he sentences you to prison for murder, after you shot someone who made you nervous. The only difference between nations and individuals in this respect is that there is no judge who can hold nations responsible for their murders.
