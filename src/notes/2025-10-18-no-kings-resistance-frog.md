Last night I drew this inflatable frog suit guy for a [mass demonstration today](https://www.nokings.org/) because I guess this is what resistance looks like now? On the opposite side I wrote “**END ICE**” in big black letters.

I really hope it's obvious that I did not use AI to generate this image. Just pencil, Sharpie, and some crayons on cardboard.

Stay safe out there today.
