Paul Scheer made a [mini-doc about Swiftie Dads on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9XN1iOungs):

> In 2023 I became obsessed with videos of dads in cargo shorts waiting in parking lots during Taylor Swift's Eras Tour. So when she came to town, I grabbed a camera and headed down to talk to them. I thought it'd be funny. It turned out to be something else entirely.
