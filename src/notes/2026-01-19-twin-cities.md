Winston has written a little on [what life looks like in the Twin Cities](https://www.winstonhearn.com/wrote/2026/notes-from-the-twin-cities/) right now:

> Right now the Federal Government is the disaster, and ICE are the chaos agents, and my community is a beautiful defensive force that will not be defeated.

I've also been reading the [testimonies from Stand With Minnesota](https://www.standwithminnesota.com/testimonies), on the ground personal eyewitness accounts of the occupation and resistance.

If you are inclined to give, [Stand With Minnesota](https://www.standwithminnesota.com/) links to various funds and mutual aid efforts right now. If you are inclined to action, [contact your member of Congress](https://secure.ngpvan.com/GFtIF3QUWEmtLXoJK3a-AQ2). 

I want to be ready if and when my own neighborhood is next. Start finding or building those networks now. [Whistle up](https://dansinker.com/posts/2025-11-21-whistle-up/).
