<p>A detailed and potentially <em>spicy</em> blog post about obtaining the International Association of Accessibility Professionals (<abbr>IAAP</abbr>) Web Accessibility Specialist (<abbr>WAS</abbr>) certification:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The accessibility field already struggles with the ‘divide’ between experts and disabled people. With a test that has an ableist focus on rote memorization, a re-certification process that adds additional burden onto a group that may already struggle with having enough spoons to do unpaid work, and an inaccessible website, it sometimes feels like the IAAP just widens the gap between practitioners and the disabled people they’re meant to serve.</p>
