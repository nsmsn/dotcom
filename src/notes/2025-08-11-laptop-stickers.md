I have already seen two photos of laptops bearing the sticker I sent out via U.S. Mail this month. I gave one of [my Luddite stickers](/notes/2025-08-02-luddite-stickers.html) to a teacher friend and she immediately slapped it on her laptop too. So that's three so far.

Its been a long time since I last made a printed product, and although this one was a pretty low-effort parody, seeing people respond to it has brought me so much joy. [I joked on Mastodon that stickers are my love language](https://social.lol/@nsmsn/115006382270153190), but I truly take delight in writing out the little note cards I'm mailing with these things.

Please keep the photos coming.
