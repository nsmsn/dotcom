Of all the type foundries out there, I like reading [Klim's release notes](https://klim.co.nz/blog/) the most. They're packed with so much personal insight in the craft of drawing letters and the business of selling them. 

The latest offering is a variable font revival of Helvetica called [Die Grotesk](https://klim.co.nz/fonts/die-grotesk/). From [Kris Sowersby's notes on the design](https://klim.co.nz/blog/die-grotesk-design-information/):

<blockquote>
<p>Why have another go at Helvetica? The truth is I’m arrogant enough to think I can make something good, and angry that the trademark holders squander the design. I’m realistic enough to know my sales will not make a dent in the man’s bottom line. I’m old enough to know the line between creative integrity and selling out is extremely blurry. I’m thirsty enough to want designers to buy and use my fonts. And, after 20 hard years of drawing letters, I am now confident enough in my ability because I have never been afraid to spend the actual time getting good.</p>
<p>It seems easy having a go at the most popular font. It’s actually really fucking hard to exhale two decades of stale breath and re-draw the typographic air that surrounds us.</p>
