**This!** [When your website makes you smile](https://jamesg.blog/2025/10/02/when-your-website-makes-you-smile) by James:

> My website is full of tiny things I made that I occasionally think about or re-discover with joy...

I open up my own website in a new window, and it greets me with a friendly "Good morning." In a [wonderfully funky font](/posts/2025-meet-dinger.html) I picked out myself recently. There's an endless rainbow of pastel background colors cycling behind my grainy right hand flashing the "V for Victory." in a small circle. These two things are _enhancements_: To view them on my home page, you need to have JavaScript enabled in your browser, or motion settings turned on your device. 

I am always thinking of adding other new things, tiny details hidden in corners of my sprawling website. Like a <code>humans.txt</code> file, unless its linked somewhere, you need to know its there.

Make something that makes yourself smile.
