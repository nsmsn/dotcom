Early this morning, I edited [yesterday's post on Understanding Comics](/2025-understanding-comics.html) to remove a chunk about the Cracker Barrel logo backlash, meme culture, and AI generated comic strips. I don't know what kind of argument I was trying to make about visual communication or visual literacy with these examples, or what any of it had to do with Scott McCloud's book. I added some observations about _creators_ and _world-building_ instead and I think it makes the post a bit easier to read.

I wanted to get the post out there Sunday, while some of my impressions were still fresh in my mind. My blogging process is a bit messy and I'm always sanding off the rough edges. This seemed like a big enough change to note here for anyone who may have noticed the missing paragraph.
