I went to my first [ABQ Zine Fest](https://www.abqzf.com/) today. I don't love big crowds, but this was my kind of crowd.

I picked up some art, buttons, chapbooks, pamphlets, stickers, and yes, zines. Bought a tote bag to put it all in, too. I think I will do most my holiday shopping here in the future. 

I hang out with bloggers and web hobbyists, and always felt some affinity for the D.I.Y. zinesters self-publishing their stuff. Amidst all the livestreamed terror, fragmentation, and slop these days, it was nice to enter a [third place](https://www.shankerinstitute.org/blog/what-are-third-places-and-why-do-they-matter) built around community and art-making. The zine fest was a breath of fresh air today.
