Screw it... I'm _sprucing_ up the ol website today with a holiday theme. I implemented [Zach Leatherman's snow-fall web component](https://www.zachleat.com/web/snow-fall/) across the site. 

My site is red and green (mostly forest green) today but the message in the footer is universal: "Peace on earth, good will to all." Happy <code>everything</code> you celebrate. 

Enjoy the holiday theme until Jan. 6 or whenever I decide to take it down.
