Brian Merchant recently collected [responses from artists, illustrators, and graphic designers](https://www.bloodinthemachine.com/p/artists-are-losing-work-wages-and) for his "AI Killed My Job" feature. Here's an excerpt from someone who used to work at Adobe and was laid off in 2023 (bold emphasis mine):

> The Firefly model still struggled to render hands and certain objects with difficulty and an Adobe company wide email sent to all employees encouraged us to sign up for an upcoming photoshoot on a green screen, holding things like trumpets, accordions, rubber chickens and asked employees to make awkward expressions like being surprised with “mouth open” or squinting while putting your finger in your ear **in exchange for a free lunch**.

The whole thing is much, much darker. Beware of free lunches.
