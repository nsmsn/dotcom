Finished reading [South to America: A Journey Below the Mason-Dixon to Understand the Soul of a Nation](https://bookshop.org/a/21729/9780062977373) by Imani Perry 📚

The American South is a complicated place. North America is a complicated place. Imani Perry’s latest book was written as a corrective to Albert Murray’s 1971 memoir/travelogue “South to a Very Old Place” (I have not read Murray’s work, but it is referenced several times in Perry’s book). This book should not be classified as a memoir or a travelougue, or a history, or poetry, or polemic. It is all of these and more.
