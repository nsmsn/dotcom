Leon, arguing for [collectives, not more tech](https://www.thisdaysportion.com/posts/collectives-not-more-tech/):

<blockquote>
<p>So, a starting point for collective blogging is a pool of folk with a range of skills to set up websites. This is no trivial undertaking: we have jobs, families, rent, mortgages, food to pay for, and work takes up an increasing amount of our time and energy. <mark>The way we think of the web is fundamentally libertarian and individual.</mark></p>

<p>Perhaps this is one area where tech will help. We could use simple, cheap tech stacks with a few options â€“ LAMP, WordPress and a set of robust themes seems an appropriate approach. But having established this foundation, we might be able to make the indieweb a more diverse place, where non-tech folk find it easier to publish their work.</p>

(Highlights mine)

I think Leon's onto something here, thinking about collective approaches over technical solutions. Perhaps a phrase like "the interdependent web" could take off alongside the indie web. I had a lot of help making this very [website version](/posts/2025-version-six.html), pair-programming with [Origami](https://weborigami.org/) creator [Jan Miksovsky](https://jan.miksovsky.com). In my experience, there are technical people out there eager and willing to help.
