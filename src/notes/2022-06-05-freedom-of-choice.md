Finished reading: [Freedom of Choice](https://bookshop.org/a/21729/9781623563448) by Evie Nagy ðŸ“š

This is (Iâ€™m pretty sure) the only authorized book about the band DEVO (or Devo), published by Bloomsbury in the 33 and 1/3 series, 35 years after the album Freedom of Choice came out.

The thesis of this book, backed up by interviews with members of DEVO, is that the recording of Freedom of Choice represented the creative and collaborative pinnacle of the band. The albumâ€™s success spelled the beginning of the end though, which is also ironic since they released six LPs after this one, never officially broke up, and are still touring today.

The book is a solid history of the band, the album and a meditation on what it means to be a Devotee.
