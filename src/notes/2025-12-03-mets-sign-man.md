I'm reading <i>They Said It Couldn't Be Done</i>, Wayne Coffey's book about the 1969 World Series. The audiobook is narrated by sports broadcaster Gary Cohen. Each chapter is packed with biographical details about the 1969 Mets roster and other key players of the events of the&nbsp;book. 

Nestled snugly in Chapter 12 (Game Three against the Baltimore Orioles) is a biography of [Karl Ehrhardt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Ehrhardt), a commercial artist better known as the "Sign Man" who was a fixture at Shea Stadium in the 1960s and 70s. Ehrhardt always wore a black derby with the Mets logo, and would carry a portfolio of about 60 handmade cardboard signs into the ball park, holding up his 20-by-26-inch messages at key moments in the seats behind third base. By the time Erhardt stopped attending games in 1981 he had created about 1,200&nbsp;signs.

You can't tell the story of the 1969 Mets without the Sign&nbsp;Man.
