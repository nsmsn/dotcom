Q: “[Why would anybody start a website?](https://daverupert.com/2025/09/why-would-anybody-start-a-website/)”

A: “[The purpose of a website is to exist!](https://laurelschwulst.com/e/ban-workshop/)”

Laurel's page linked above documents a workshop she led, and while I wish there was more I could glimpse, the title itself is a sufficient explanation.

I've seen other great responses to this question this week, [from Ana](https://ohhelloana.blog/why/):

> We, humans, are driven to touch and craft with our body. Deep down we crave that. Website making is a digital craft.

and [from Jim](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2025/why-make-a-website-in-2025/):

> The same reason you would bake a batch of cookies: because you enjoy it — the process itself, but also the result. And perhaps, if you like, you share the result with others.
