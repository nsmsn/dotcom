J.B. Crawford, "[The year the internet grew up](https://www.fastcompany.com/91363294/why-1995-was-the-year-the-internet-grew-up)" (Fast Company):

<blockquote>
<p>The internet wasn’t born whole—it came together from parts. Most know of ARPANET, the internet’s most famous precursor, but it was always limited strictly to government use. It was NSFNET that brought many networks together, and the internet that we use today is almost NSFNET itself.</p>

<p>Almost, but not quite: in 1995, the government that had raised the internet from its infancy gave it a firm shove out the door. Call it a graduation, or a coming of age. I think of it as the internet getting its first real job.</p>

_Fast Company_ has been running a series called "[1995 Week](https://www.fastcompany.com/section/1995-week)," all about the groundbreaking technologies released that year.
