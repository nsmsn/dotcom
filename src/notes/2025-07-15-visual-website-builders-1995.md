<p>Step into 1995: when the web got images, JavaScript, and visual dev tools. This is how it all began, where it went wrong, and how it's still going wrong today.</p>

[Salma](https://whitep4nth3r.com/) works for [Nordcraft](https://nordcraft.com/), which is sort of an open-source Webflow alternative/competitor and spends a bit of time in this video explaining why this visual tool is better than trying to build and publish your sites with [Figma Sites](https://adrianroselli.com/2025/05/do-not-publish-your-designs-on-the-web-with-figma-sites.html). Today's the first I've heard of Nordcraft, and I'm curious to investigate it a bit further.
