It's actually easier than I thought to switch music streaming services. I got an invite to try two free months of [Qobuz](https://www.qobuz.com/) just as my Apple Music subscription is up at the end of this week.

I only set up my account the other day and already managed to import 50 playlists (and more than 10,000 saved tracks) fairly quick through [Soundiiz](https://soundiiz.com), a third party interface for moving music libraries. I went ahead and imported another 35 even older playlists (and over 800 tracks) from my old Spotify to Qobuz through Soundiiz.

Now a part of me almost wishes I started with a blank slate. Maybe I will need to spend some time pruning old playlists. Soundgardening, if you will.
