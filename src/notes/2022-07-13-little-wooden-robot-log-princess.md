A wonderful picture book for kids (and adults too): [The Little Wooden Robot and the Log Princess](https://micro.blog/books/9780823450671) by Tom Gauld.

I was familiar with some of Tom Gauld’s cartoons as well as his covers for the New Yorker. The simple shapes and intricate cross hatching of his art translates well from the comics panel to the storybook spread.

My niece and nephew liked this book and I will enjoy reading this bedtime story to my daughter.
