<p>
This is a tiny content strategy framework focused on goals, messages, and branding. This is not a checklist. Use what you need and scrap the rest. Rewrite it or add to it. These topics should help you get to the bottom of things with clients and other people you work with.

<p>This is something I regularly use. In fact, I'm using it right now on a project! I have this GitHub gist starred, but thought I'd post a public bookmark if in case it helps others.</p>
