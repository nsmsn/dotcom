[I wrote a bit about the 1995 film <i>Hackers</i>](/posts/2025-hack-the-planet.html) as a visual time capsule of 1990s cyberculture. Make sure to check out the [cyberdelia collection](https://cari.institute/aesthetics/cyberdelia) of images for more examples of this aesthetic.

> Named for the club in the film, Hackers (1995), this is psychedelic side of [Early Cyber](https://cari.institute/aesthetics/early-cyber) & [Silicon Dreams](https://cari.institute/aesthetics/silicon-dreams), featuring visual elements like kaleidoscopic palettes, acid colors, fractal forms, and expressive early 3D typography.
