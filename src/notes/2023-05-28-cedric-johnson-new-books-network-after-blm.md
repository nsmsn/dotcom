Want to read [After Black Lives Matter](https://bookshop.org/a/21729/9781804293003) by Cedric Johnson 📚

Johnson was on a recent [New Books Network podcast](https://newbooksnetwork.com/cedric-johnson-after-black-lives-matter-policing-and-anti-capitalist-struggle-verso-2023) to talk about his new book on policing and anti-capitalist struggle.🎙️ At the end of the podcast, he has a chance to discuss some of the interesting work he’s doing as an urbanist studying the Olympic Games in Los Angeles ahead of the 2028 Games.
