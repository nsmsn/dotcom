For those wondering, [Blacksky's migration guide](https://docs.blacksky.community/migrating-to-blacksky-pds-complete-guide) works pretty well. I joined the <code>cryptoanarchy.network</code> PDS because it sounded spicier. I'm also using my shorter <code>nicks.im</code> custom domain for [my profile](https://blacksky.community/profile/did:plc:34426v334rdehfd2rapmaapr).

I did notice some missing media attachments on some of my older posts, but most of those are backed up on this website anyway. But overall, smooth migration experience. Older mentions (my previous <code>nicksimson.com</code> username) are actually linked to the <code>did:plc:34426v334rdehfd2rapmaapr</code> profile, which means they functionally redirect.

If you decide you want to switch from Bluesky PBC to Blacksky hosting, I recommend [supporting the team on Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/blacksky) too. Running the infrastructure isn't cheap, and their subscriber tier starts at $7 a month.
