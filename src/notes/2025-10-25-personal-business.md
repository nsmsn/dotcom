Charles Broskoski on [Personal Business](https://www.are.na/editorial/personal-business):

> A Personal Business is run by people who are truly into what they are doing, and invested enough to offer products, services, and/or experiences that are both high-quality and idiosyncratic. The type of business that both sustains and is sustained by a community. Think of the bodega down the street that will accept your packages for you, or restaurants that have been in operation for as long as you can remember, or a store that you stop in just to chat. These particular attributes aren’t strategic (though they are strengths). Rather, they arise from the people who run it, who are cool and love what they do. Maybe most importantly, a Personal Business is properly scaled. It doesn’t have to be small, but it should grow at a pace that optimizes for its own resilience rather than to dominate a market.
