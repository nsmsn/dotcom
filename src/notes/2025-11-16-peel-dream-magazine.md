Algorithmically, I thought I should know [Peel Dream Magazine](https://peeldreammagazine.bandcamp.com/) by now. Their music has been compared to some of my personal favorites Broadcast, Stereolab, and Yo La Tengo. The "Peel" in their name is a dedication to the late BBC Radio1 deejay [John Peel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Peel). I'm just old enough that the phrase "Peel Session" means something to me. PDM is also on a favorite label, [Topshelf Records](https://www.topshelfrecords.com/) (I'm in the&nbsp;Discord).

Ah well. I found my way to this music via the [SimpleBits Studio Notes](https://simplebits.com/notebook/studio-notes-58/) newsletter. Dan writes he heard them on SiriusXM. Long live the radio and the personal recommendation.

<a href="https://peeldreammagazine.bandcamp.com/album/rose-main-reading-room"><i>Rose Main Reading Room</i></a> is a great name for a concept album about New York City and its landmarks. This is a "headphones record"; baroque pop meets Y2K dream pop sounds. I love everything I've heard so far, and my ears are hungry for&nbsp;more.
