Jay Hoffmann asks "[Do blogs need to be so lonely?](https://thehistoryoftheweb.com/do-blogs-need-to-be-so-lonely/)": 

> I’m picturing something relatively simple. Something like a group blog, or a blog co-op. A group of internet friends posting together, without too much oversight or coordination between them. When somebody has an idea, they post. Others can respond to those posts in new posts. Or not. And together, a group of people chip away at a blog together. Personally, I’d love to be in a group like that.

Me too, Jay!
