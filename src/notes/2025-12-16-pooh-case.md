Giles Turnbull, [How to use Pooh case](https://gilest.org/notes/pooh-case.html)

> Pooh case should be used sparingly. It should be used to Make A Point, but in a gentle, Pooh sort of way. It’s probably ok to use it at work, but not if you are referring to strategy documents and finance updates. Ideally, you should save Pooh case for occasions involving Woozles, Heffalumps, Busy Days, Expotitions and Enchanted Places - or the work equivalents thereof.
