David Velasco (former editor of <cite>Artforum</cite>), on [How Gaza Broke the Art World](https://www.equator.org/articles/how-gaza-broke-the-art-world):

<blockquote>
<p>I don’t know why I thought we were an exception. Maybe because sometimes we were. <cite>Artforum</cite>, for many years, was about as leftist as an elite publication could get. We really did play a role in holding weapons manufacturers and the engineers of the opioid crisis to account. We really did give jobs and bylines to some singular and brilliant people. We really were a brainy refuge of weird glamour married to principle, and sometimes I wonder if mine is the last generation to grow up thinking of the art world as a place for ungovernable outsiders and talented eccentrics, which doesn’t hear the word ‘art’ and think immediately of commerce...</p>

<p>...Palestine is different. Even with broad public support, no major museum has taken up the genocide in Gaza. No large institution I know of has put on an exhibition about Palestinian artists or Palestinian lives. Instead, the opposite: in June 2025, the Whitney Museum “suspended” its 57-year-old Independent Study Program after some of its members dared to host a performance critical of Israel. The art world, with all its progressive scaffolding and humanist ornamentation, practically designed to celebrate and aestheticise every rebellion, couldn’t metabolise Palestine. It still can’t.</p>
