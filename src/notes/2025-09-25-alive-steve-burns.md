In the late 1990s, [Steve Burns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Burns) hosted a children's television show called _Blue's Clues_. His new podcast [Alive](https://lemonadamedia.com/show/alive-with-steve-burns/) feels like a continuation of that work, but for an audience that has also aged about 25&nbsp;years.

I'm not a huge podcast person (I dip in and out), but I did enjoy [Steve's interview with Jamie Lee Curtis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRy-7ENcvoU). Watch the video production if you can&mdash;that's a link to&nbsp;YouTube.

Their conversation included a discussion about how much of the Internet feeds off conflict, not unlike reality TV; the path to sobriety and beginning to see oneself as an artist; Steve's dislike of the word "authentic"; and plenty about _Everything Everywhere All at Once_ and _The Bear_. I particularly loved the stories behind Jamie Lee Curtis' children's books, and the way both host and guest connected over trying to create good art for&nbsp;kids.

Thanks to [James/MacManX](https://macmanx.com/) for putting this one on my&nbsp;radar.
