From [what is anisota.net?](https://anisota.net/profile/dame.is/document/3lxankooyf22l) by [Dame](https://dame.is/):

> At its core, [anisota.net]((https://anisota.net/)) is an experimental social media interface and game for Bluesky and the AT Protocol. You don't "scroll" through an endless feed of posts. Instead, you flip through a finite deck of cards until you run out of stamina. You don't see engagement metrics front and center, instead each post has a "rarity" icon as if it were a trading card. You can collect post cards into curated decks that can then be shared with others. There are even in-game items, specimen collecting, and soon to be quests.

I found it pretty simple to login with my atproto account, and go through the tutorial. Here's what [my profile on anisota](https://anisota.net/profile/nicks.im) looks like. I wasn't expecting to like a "gameified" social media interface, but this has more _art project_ energy than _casino_ vibes.
