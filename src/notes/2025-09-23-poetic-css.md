<blockquote>
<p>There's one CSS 'rule' I always come back to – the heart of what I'm calling Poetic CSS: What are we trying to express, and how clearly can we express it?</p>

<p>There's no best unit, best layout mode, or best selectors – only the ones that express our goals most clearly. Use the whole language.</p>
