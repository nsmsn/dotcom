I got a new computer recently and I _think_ I configured NVM, NPM, and all the dependencies this site runs on correctly so I can update my website from this new machine.

I RSVP'd to an IndieWeb event today: [IndieWeb Black Friday Create Day — Build Don't Buy](https://events.indieweb.org/2025/11/indieweb-black-friday-create-day-build-don-t-buy-C044CcYllKyt). A clever bit of holiday season counter-programming. I'll see if I can work on the site a bit on my day off today.
