<p>Brian’s reflection on his three and a half years working with a federal contractor on VA.gov is worthy of your time. Especially if you spend any time thinking about digital accessibility, governance in a large organization, or what is going on with the U.S. federal government workforce at this present moment.</p>

<p>Hard to pick just one excerpt worth sharing, but I really liked this:</p>

<blockquote><p>I’ve found that designers and developers respond really well to transparent feedback that engages them in a discussion of the problem, and we’ve come up with some really interesting solutions from those conversations. In my experience, innovation comes from a place of sincere interest in the perspectives of others, a place of valuing their professionalism, expertise, and problem-solving abilities.</p>
