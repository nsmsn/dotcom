Henry (from Online) published [A website to destroy all websites](https://henry.codes/writing/a-website-to-destroy-all-websites/), a transcription of a talk delivered at [WebDevConf in Bristol](https://webdevconf.com/) in 2025. It will be familiar territory for anyone who has read or written a persuasive "joining the indie web" blog post in the last few years. I think you should still read it, particularly if you are feeling stuck or hung up on Making That Website in 2026. Read this, and go Make That Website.

I particularly liked this little bit here on design:

> Don’t worry about design unless that’s the part that brings you joy. Make friends with designers and trade your work for theirs, or trade tips, trade advice. Get comfortable with being joyfully bad at something — from that soil of humility grows a million questions for those who have learned and are excited to share. Iterate until you’ve something you’re proud of, or iterate so much you’ve ruined it and have to go back to bald.
