<p>Reilly’s guide reminded me how easy it is to get up and running with <a href="https://webmention.io/">Webmention.io</a> on a static site. I have a very minimal setup working. At least I can see I was successful sending and recieving them this weekend.</p>

<p>But I don’t think I will set up an automated process for displaying them on my site again. As far as I understand the spec, displaying these things is optional??? I am subscribed to an Atom feed of new webmention notifications, and for me that is enough for right now.</p>
