Joe Crawford argues [we are in a web renaissance now](https://artlung.com/blog/2026/02/08/we-are-in-a-web-renaissance-now/):

<blockquote>
<p>I like getting asked questions about the web. I love trying to answer. If I can’t answer, I usually can point to a resource. Or I end up learning something new <em>because</em> of a question.</p>

<p>When people are curious and uneasy, and conditions are dodgy, that’s when things on the web rebirth.</p>
</blockquote>

If we are truly in a web renaissance right now, I wonder about the various "movements" flourishing on the web today. I can't help but think of something like the [diagram website](https://diagram.website/) reading these words.
