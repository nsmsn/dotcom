Enjoyed this conversation with Rudy Fraser about [Blacksky Algorithms](https://blackskyweb.xyz/overview/) and decentralized tech, on Bridget Todd's podcast _There Are No Girls On The Internet_: [Can BlackSky Fix What Twitter Broke Using Bluesky Tech?](https://www.iheart.com/podcast/1119-there-are-no-girls-on-the-65877505/episode/can-blacksky-fix-what-twitter-broke-301699967/)
