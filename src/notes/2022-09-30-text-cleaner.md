When you copy text from a word processor, PDF, web page, or client brief, you usually copy all the formatting and unwanted characters. There might be duplicate line breaks, multiple spaces, wrong quotation marks, escaped HTML tags, different letter cases, and other details that you want to remove or change to “unformat” your text. [Text Cleaner](https://textcleaner.net/) offers a quick and easy way to do so.

The all-in-one text cleaning and formatting online tool performs all necessary operations for you to bring copied text into shape. You can tweak the settings for cleaning and formatting based on your personal preferences and copy and paste your text into the input box. Then click the “clean” button, and the cleaned-up version magically appears.
