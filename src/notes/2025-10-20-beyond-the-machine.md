Frank Chimero, on [Creative agency in the AI landscape](https://frankchimero.com/blog/2025/beyond-the-machine/):

<blockquote>
<p>Thinking of AI as an instrument recenters the focus on practice. Instruments require a performance that relies on technique—the horn makes the sound, but how and what you blow into it matters; the drum machine keeps time and plays the samples, but what you sample and how you swing on top of it becomes your signature.</p>
<p>In other words, instruments can surprise you with what they offer, but they are not automatic. In the end, they require a touch. You use a tool, but you <em>play</em> an instrument. It’s a more expansive way of doing, and the doing of it all is important, because that’s where you develop the instincts for excellence. There is no purpose to better machines if they do not also produce better humans.</p>
