Barry Petchesky, on [Game 7 of the 2025 World Series](https://defector.com/toronto-will-never-get-over-this?giftLink=bd601f419e83dcf7bacd8f40fbdc73d5) for <i>Defector</i>:

> Baseball makes you feel bad... I mean that baseball at its best, when the beats are on rhythm and when the high notes are hit, can be downright torture to watch. At the most stressful moments, the time between pitches allows you a regular moment to be alone with your agony—to bite fingernails or breathe shallowly or pace your living room. Then the pitch is delivered, and there's just enough time to hope or fear, but, likely as not, a ball is fouled off and you get to do it all again. And again and again and again. Sometimes several unexpected bonus innings of it. Heart disease as a hobby. Whoever invented baseball had a cruel streak. Whoever enjoys it has a touch of masochism.
