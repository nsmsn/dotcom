Finished reading [Sea of Tranquility](https://bookshop.org/a/21729/9780593466735) by Emily St. John Mandel ðŸ“š

I didnâ€™t realize there would be pandemic themes going into this one, but it was interesting to see characters and settings from the earlier book, The Glass Hotel. Overall, I enjoyed the plot, pacing, and time travel elements.
