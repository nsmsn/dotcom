Here's a great introductory post written by Rob Arcand on his brand new blog: [Why Bother? A Statement of Purpose](https://robarcand.info/blog/why-bother-a-statement-of-purpose). The background of this post is about working in academia and losing his PhD advisor to cancer last year. Rob's mentor made his life's work to produce "better citizens of reality" and even long maintained a [personal website](https://sterneworks.org/) with resources for academics at every stage of their career.

> As I continue forward through this difficult, rewarding PhD process, I am reminded of Jonathan’s web presence, and how much I want to develop a similar site of my own. Looking through the old photos and blog posts his site contains as part of the preservation process has shown me how powerful a personal website can be, both to oneself as a personal archive and to the larger community it can cultivate. I want to use this site, blog, and newsletter to better document the work I’m doing, and make a deliberate space to produce new work on my own terms. I look forward to doing that together, in public, with you.
