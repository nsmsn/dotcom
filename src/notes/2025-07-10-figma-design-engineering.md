<blockquote>
<p>Over the course of the last five years, Iâ€™ve grown increasingly worried about what Figma is doing to the field of design by pushing designers toward an engineering-centric way of working. This can be seen in their feature releases: Smart Components, Variables, Auto Layout, and Interactive Prototypes. These features are often celebrated as steps toward parity with engineering, but in practice, they encourage a mode of working that narrows the field of possibility at precisely the moment when it should be expanding.</p>
