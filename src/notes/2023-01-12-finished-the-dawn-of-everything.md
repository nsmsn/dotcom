Finished reading: [The Dawn of Everything: A New History of Humanity](https://micro.blog/books/9780771049835) by David Graeber and David Wengrow 📚

This book is worth reading, as are the critiques of it, especially the [responses by Chris Knight, Nancy Lindisfarne, and Jonathan Neale](https://climateandcapitalism.com/2021/12/17/the-dawn-of-everything-gets-human-history-wrong/). I would not waste your time with any reviews penned by employees of the American Enterprise Institute.

I’m glad I finished this book and found it worth engaging with. Graeber and Wengrow present a much more hopeful view of humanity than the other popular titles in the Big Histories genre they are in argument with, including “Sapiens” and “Guns, Germs and Steel”.
