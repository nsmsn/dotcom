<p>Whether it’s finding a job, receiving education, looking for a home, or otherwise fully participating in modern civic, cultural, and economic life, a high-speed internet connection is a requirement. Yet many New Yorkers don’t have a reliable connection to the internet at home. The “digital divide” between those with a connection and those without was thrown into stark relief during the early days of the COVID lockdown, when some could learn, work, and access healthcare from the safety of their homes, while others had to risk their own health and the health of others to access basic necessities—or go without. But this divide existed prior to the crisis, and it will be with us long after unless it is addressed head-on. This is not a technological problem—the technology exists as does the capacity to build and maintain it. This is a political problem, one grounded in the question of whose interests the construction of infrastructure serves. To solve this problem, we need to look at the economic and historical factors that lead to our current moment.</p>
