Started reading _[Sure, I'll Join Your Cult: A Memoir of Mental Illness and the Quest to Belong Anywhere](https://bookshop.org/a/21729/9781982168575)_ ðŸ“š by Maria Bamford, ISBN: 9781982168568

Maria Bamford is known for her hilarious voice talents, so of course I'm listening to the audiobook version.
