Currently reading: [The Shame Machine](https://bookshop.org/a/21729/9781984825452) by Cathy Oâ€™Neil ðŸ“š

I picked up Oâ€™Neilâ€™s last book â€˜Weapons of Math Destructionâ€™ when it came out and it left an impression on me. â€˜The Shame Machineâ€™ explores how shame (on a macro level) is used as a way to shift responsibility for social problems from institutions to individuals.
