Go read Coyote's latest post, [Which Part of the Indie Web Ethos is the Bigger Priority?](https://osteophage.neocities.org/essays/indie-web-priorities) It's a great post, wrestling with some challenging questions.

Webmention is how I found this one so quickly. [One of my older notes](/notes/2024-01-09-an-easier-indie-web.html) (from January 2024) is linked in this. Reading my older note now makes me cringe a bit. What a difference a couple years' perspective makes.

My definition of "indie web" is still broad, and I want it to be inclusive. I see having a presence on the web as something bigger than a hobby&mdash;it's your _voice_. 

My favorite bit from Coyote:

> If it’s not for someone whose every dollar is already being sucked up by survival, then it’s not for everyone. If it’s not for the hungry and the homeless then it’s not for everyone. If it’s not for the refugee and the runaway then it’s not for everyone. If it depends on having cash to spare on renting a custom domain name then it’s not for everyone. People in these demographics do use the internet, and they deserve better than to be ground up for a predatory machine, which is why we need more options that are easy and free and independent from venture capital and corporate giants.
