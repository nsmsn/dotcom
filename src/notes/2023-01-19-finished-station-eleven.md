Finished reading: [Station Eleven](https://bookshop.org/a/21729/9780804172448) by Emily St. John Mandel ðŸ“š

This the second novel about a fictional pandemic (and the immediate collapse of society) I managed to finish recently. The other one was _Severance_ (2018) by Ling Ma. Both books were written and published in the years before the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

No more dystopian pandemic fiction for me for a little while.
