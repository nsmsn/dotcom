<p>Healthy digital spaces need the same foundations as physical ones (roads, rules, records, etc) so we can build the flourishing fun bits on top. If the web’s first generation gave us villages, and the second gave us gross, unliveable megacities, the next one should give us great neighbourhoods — small, knowable, human-scaled spaces where we can actually live together online.</p>

<p>The thing about neighbourhoods is that they don’t appear by accident. Someone has to plant the trees, pave the footpaths, decide where the park benches go. The same is true online. We need infrastructure that makes it easy for groups to stay — not just start. Right now, we’re trying to host potlucks in chat apps built for drive-through service. Let’s work out how to change that.</p>
