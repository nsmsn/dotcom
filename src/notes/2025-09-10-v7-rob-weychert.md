[Rob Weychert's About page](https://v7.robweychert.com/about/), on his recently re-launched V7 personal site:

<blockquote>
<p>I love the web, but I don’t love what’s become of it. It’s over-engineered, overrun with slop, and dominated by data-harvesting gated communities that thrive on invective and conspicuous consumption. So I work hard to make my site an avatar of the open, independent, human-centered web I want to see: It’s a place to share the minutia of my personal enthusiasms on my own terms.</p>
</blockquote>

In [Rob's latest blog post announcing the new site](https://v7.robweychert.com/blog/2025/09/v7-launch-day/), he writes about starting this project in January 2020 and taking his time, letting ideas percolate, until the product caught up to his vision. V7 is impressive as a blog archive, media diary, portfolio, and more. There's a lot to explore, and plenty to take inspiration from. The typeface [Degular](https://ohnotype.co/fonts/degular) shines here as well.
