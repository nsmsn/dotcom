[Naz Hamid writing about his new project Letter Club](https://nazhamid.com/journal/letter-club/):

> Not physical letters, but digital letters that arrive with traditional mail's rhythm. It's a private group newsletter that everyone contributes to and receives. It's intentionally slow, purposeful, and deeply gratifying â€” a low-stress, high-signal way to stay connected that creates meaningful moments in a social world dominated by drive-by likes and fleeting attention.

I switched to following a lot of newsletters via RSS, because they are frankly blog-like digests. A community driven newsletter like this sounds cozy and more appropriate for my inbox. [Jason](https://endonend.org/) has already started one of these for [Crucial Tracks](https://www.crucialtracks.org/) and I'm eager to give this format a try.
