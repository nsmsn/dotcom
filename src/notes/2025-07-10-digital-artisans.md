<blockquote>
<p>The fundamental difference for the artisan model is that it operates in parallel, driven by the workers themselves. Each artisan retains full autonomy of their own specialism, but chooses to supplement their knowledge about how adjacent disciplines relate to theirs. Most importantly, this is done not with the intent to replace the other specialist, but to inform and elevate the quality of one's own work. This comes with a mutual accountability on doing what is right for the end-user rather than on convenience and expediency. Being an artisan is less about hoarding and regurgitating 'acquired' knowledge, and more about being part of a distributed support network of talented individuals. Success is a matter of community. To focus on craft is to stand on the shoulders of those who came before and lift those who come after.</p>
