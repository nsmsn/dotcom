I spent a good chunk of the morning listening to [the _Rebuilding_ soundtrack](https://james-elkington.bandcamp.com/album/rebuilding), which came out today and I think will be a part of my "music for getting work done" rotation. Music by Jake Xerxes Fussell and James Elkington with Nick Macri (upright bass) and Anna Jacobson (brass and strings).

A good soundtrack should give you the feel of the story's time and place and characters. The album artwork by [Julienne Alexander](https://www.yssrs.com/about) is quite resonant too. I'm very interested in watching [the film](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt29361963/).
