Beth DeConinck, on [the politics of accessibility](https://bethdeconinck.com/the-politics-of-accessibility/):

<blockquote>
<p>When the new administration issued an executive order targeting DEIA programs, I heard people express shock that the “A” stands for “Accessibility.” They felt that it somehow felt out of place alongside diversity, equity, and inclusion, that it was a different thing.</p>

<p>When the dust from that order started to settle, I heard people emphasizing that there’s a difference between the accessibility that I do — technical stuff, stuff where people are writing code, stuff related to Section 508 compliance — and some other kind of accessibility, the DEIA kind, that’s all about training and hiring and non-technical stuff like that.</p>

<p>It is not currently in my financial interests to comment on any of the specifics of what’s happening in the world. But I do want to comment briefly on the inherently political nature of accessibility.</p>
