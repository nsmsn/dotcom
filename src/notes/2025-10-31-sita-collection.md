<blockquote>
<p>The Sita Collection is a superfamily rooted in 19th-century Scottish typographic history that offers a contemporary interpretation of the past to suit modern needs for digital and print typesetting. The collection comprises two styles across four weights, with corresponding italics.</p>

<p>Sita Sans and Sita Serif are designed for optimal form and weight harmony when composed side by side. Sharing the same skeleton, the two families complement each other while retaining the distinctive characteristics of the transitional and grotesque genres of the 19th century.
