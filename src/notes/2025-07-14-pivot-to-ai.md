Jason Koebler, 404 Media: "[The Media's Pivot to AI Is Not Real and Not Going to Work](https://www.404media.co/the-medias-pivot-to-ai-is-not-real-and-not-going-to-work/?ref=daily-stories-newsletter)" (paywall/email-wall):

> AI is a tool (sorry!) that people who are bad at their jobs will use badly and that people who are good at their jobs will maybe, possibly find some uses for. People who are terrible at their jobs (many executives), will tell their employees that they “need” to use AI, that their jobs depend on it, that they must become more productive, and that becoming an AI-first company is the strategy that will save them from the old failed strategy, which itself was the new strategy after other failed business models.
