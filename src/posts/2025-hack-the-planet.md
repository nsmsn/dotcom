This month’s [IndieWeb Movie Club selection](https://www.benji.dog/articles/indieweb-movie-club-october-2025/) is the 1995 film <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackers_(film)"><i>Hackers</i></a>, directed by Iain Softley and starring Jonny Lee Miller and Angelina&nbsp;Jolie.

I never saw <i>Hackers</i> before my first viewing last night, and I've often confused this title with the 1992 film <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sneakers_(1992_film)"><i>Sneakers</i></a>, starring Robert Redford. <i>Hackers</i> was released 30 years ago this month, and is considered a 1990s cult classic. I think I enjoyed this film’s premise (teenagers try to take down an evil corporate security officer who writes a computer virus trying to frame the same group of teens) much more than the execution, but I was nevertheless entertained for nearly two&nbsp;hours.

In addition to a serviceable car chase/rollerblading scene through Manhattan, there is plenty of hacking: some tampering with traffic lights and pay phones, and scenes of characters typing away at their terminals to penetrate computer networks. Without revealing spoilers, I do want to talk about where this film really shines: mesmerizing graphics and visual eye&nbsp;candy. 

A overhead view of skyscrapers and the streets below dissolves into a neon-lit circuit board; layers of textual information move around in a three dimensional space as a teenage hacker tries to download a file; A familiar Macintosh operating system UI  interrupted by heavy grunge fonts; cutaways and montages of random images flashing; 3-D text, eyepatched smileys, and an animated Cookie Monster darts across a screen like Pac-Man. The visuals are a little bit like the pages of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Gun_(magazine)"><i>Ray Gun</i></a> or early <i>Wired</i> magazine brought to life, but more chaotic. Seemingly every character is costumed in an angular haircut, tiny sunglasses, a motorcycle jacket, or goth&nbsp;attire.

No, the hacking scenes are not realistic at all, but these visuals capture a specific time in computer history, and do a pretty good job transporting you to into a hidden world—not unlike <i>Tron</i> did in the 1980s or <i>The Matrix</i> would at the turn of the millennium—all at a time when the Internet was becoming mainstream and the HTML 2.0 standard finally supported the <code>img</code>&nbsp;tag.

Hackers is not currently streaming with any subscription services, but you can rent it on a few platforms, borrow a physical copy from your public library, or use your own ingenuity to find a way to watch it online. It’s worth a first screening for the visuals and soundtrack, or perhaps to laugh along at the dialogue with your cyberpunk&nbsp;buddies.
