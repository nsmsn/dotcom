Depending on how tired I am on Wednesday evening, how easily I can get my kid to bed, and whether I have a work meeting (cameras off, thankfully) at 7:00 am the next day, I am an infrequent presence at the virtual Home Brew Website Club.

This meetup happens ever other Wednesday at 6pm in the U.S. Pacific time zone, and is an [official IndieWeb.org event](https://events.indieweb.org/). The first one of these I attended was in 2021, and I’ve since made a number of internet pals through these informal settings and sprawling community. There are other virtual and in-person events happening all the time, and even if you can’t make it to an event, there are still ways of participating in [the IndieWeb movement](https://indieweb.org/). I subscribe to the generous, inclusive [Jeremy Keith definition of indie web](https://adactio.com/journal/tags/indiewebcamp), that if you have your own website, you are a participant in this movement.

Anyway, at a Home Brew Website Club meeting in October last year, we were discussing the various [IndieWeb swag](https://indieweb.org/swag) available, and [Benji of benji.dog fame](https://benji.dog/) mentioned he would buy and wear an IndieWeb shirt if instead of the official logo it was rendered as a heavy metal logo, with questionable legibility, rendered in tangled, thorny tendrils. As a trained graphic designer, when you hear someone say something should be a tee shirt, you get ideas of how to make such a thing happen.

I’m happy to announce you can now buy the unofficial IndieWeb heavy metal shirt or tote bag from [CottonBureau.com](https://cottonbureau.com/people/nick-simson). The sales of these print-on-demand products ($2 from each shirt and tote) will make their way to a donation to IndieWeb.org’s Open Collective. The shirts come in a couple variants: [a black logo](https://cottonbureau.com/p/2RF754/shirt/indieweb-is-metal) on graphite (my personal fave), natural, or purple, as well as [a purple logo on black shirt](https://cottonbureau.com/p/SAGWTG/shirt/indieweb-is-metal-purple-on-black) variant. The tote bags are [black on natural](https://cottonbureau.com/p/476ZPW/tote/indieweb-is-metal) and [purple on black](https://cottonbureau.com/p/PK5UV6/tote/indieweb-is-metal-purple-on-black), with the graphic printed as big as Cotton Bureau will allow us to print it. These are **pretty big** tote bags too: 15 inches by 16 inches, great for stuff like groceries and vinyl records.

The design itself was a commission, as my heavy metal lettering skills are not nearly this sophisticated. I found [Liam](https://www.fiverr.com/neon_cacti), a lettering artist who specializes in metal logos, on Fiverr. I still somewhat conflicted about using the Fiverr platform, but Liam’s portfolio demonstrated he could execute what I had in mind. We agreed on a price and I left him a generous tip too. So in late 2024, I had digital artwork, and [uploaded my idea as a GitHub issue](https://github.com/indieweb/branding/issues/17).

[Benji subsequently printed up some stickers](https://www.benji.dog/notes/1733601983/) and as has been giving them away at IndieWeb events (and hopefully sticking them all over Minneapolis). But the shirts haven’t happened on the IndieWeb shop. This summer, I learned of the [IndieWeb is Punk shirt and sticker](https://jimmitchell.org/2025/06/19/indieweb-is-punk-indeed/) and thought maybe there was a little more I could do with the artwork I commissioned. Liam did grant me ownership of this art, including permissions to print and sell stickers, tees and other merch to benefit IndieWeb.org. At the very least Benji and I would each order one. IndieWeb is punk, but also metal.

I’ve also been on a sticker kick lately, after quickly selling out of [my Luddite stickers](https://nicks.im/notes/2025-08-02-luddite-stickers). So when I reordered my Luddite design, I thought I would give the glow-in-the-dark stickers a try. I sent a few to Benji already, and have them listed now in my ko-fi shop. Glow-in-the-dark is a bit more expensive to print on, so [I’m selling these for $12 for a two-pack](https://ko-fi.com/s/a4d98e4503) with $1 per sticker going to IndieWeb.org’s Open Collective. Also, if you sign up for my [Chaos Club site membership](https://ko-fi.com/nsmsn/tiers) ($1 a month or more) with a mailing address, I will send you all my stickers, including the glowing IndieWeb variant.

Printing stickers is not printing money, and I hope the official [IndieWeb shop](https://indieweb.printful.me/) will eventually adopt these (and more) designs as their own. In the meantime, it is fun to get a physical product you want to see out in the real world.

Finally,  Liam, the lettering artist also happens to do voiceover work and can record himself speaking in a demonic voice. So I hired him again to record a simple promo for IndieWeb.org:
