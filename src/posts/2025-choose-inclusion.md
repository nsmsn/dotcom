Adam Newbold’s post on “The InclusiveWeb” (sadly no longer up) really resonated with me last year. Especially this part:

> An IndieWeb that isn’t **inclusive** offers no value to the world. An IndieWeb built by and for only certain people isn’t a web at all. An IndieWeb that allows someone to feel like less of a person is a tragedy.

The particular developer Adam called out at the time still works on [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog/) (M.b. for short) which hosts blogs but also a small but significant social network, built on [IndieWeb principles](https://indieweb.org/principles). Adam published a follow up post today called “Accountability” detailing an exchange, or series of exchanges he had with [Manton Reece](https://manton.org/), the creator and primary developer behind Micro.blog, on what he sees as problematic behavior by the contractor or staff. You can also read [Manton’s timeline](https://micro.blog/manton) or his blog posts to get his perspective.

I followed some of this in real time on my Mastodon feed and M.b. timeline yesterday and today. I’m pretty sure its still going on, even though [Manton decided to mute Adam](https://www.manton.org/2025/01/22/ive-had-to-mute-adam.html). I don’t normally weigh in on public spats, but I’ve given money to both Manton and Adam to use their products. I used to host a blog on M.b. and I still syndicate my RSS feeds to a [M.b. account](https://micro.blog/nsmsn), and interact with people on the timeline. I have a [omg.lol account](https://nsmsn.co/) and use [social.lol as my primary home](https://social.lol/@nsmsn) on the fediverse.

They’re not competing products, by the way. Both give people a presence on the open web, and are **trying** to be better versions of social media. I put “**trying**” in bold type. If you go to the Micro.blog landing page you’ll see a statement (my emphasis):

> Micro.blog is a small team **trying** to make the web a little better.

I think you try by choosing the side of inclusion.

Sadly, where I think Adam was trying to shine a little sunlight, Manton saw the criticism as a personal attack and is digging in right now. At least that’s how I interpret it.

When I first joined M.b. the first comment I received on my [first post](https://micro.blog/nsmsn/12757388) was a friendly “Welcome to the nicest place online 🙂”. I’ve never felt abused or belittled on the platform, but I’m also a straight dude with a fair complexion. There’s a lot of us on Micro.blog.

While its good to be treated nice, its by far better to be treated with _kindness_, and to have your very being _affirmed_.

[I asked about the community guidelines](https://micro.blog/nsmsn/55672455) since Manton said he’d be taking a look, and was reminded that his social network has been flying for some time without a dedicated community manager. There was a community manager, Jean, at the time I joined in 2022, and it was one thing that drew me to the network in the first place. I’m not sure exactly why Jean left, but I hope Manton sees this role as a value add to the thing he’s trying to build. If I were in his shoes, I’d be trying to fill that role with intention and input from the community.

As of this afternoon, it looks like there’s been an update to the [community guidelines](https://help.micro.blog/t/community-guidelines/39):

> LGBTQ+ and marginalized communities who haven’t felt at home on larger platforms may especially be looking for a new, welcoming place. Micro.blog should be a safe place for everyone — a dedicated blog at your own website, and a community space without harassment. Everyone deserves to live authentically, free from fear or discrimination, regardless of who they love or how they identify. LGBTQ+ rights are human rights.

This language is a step in the right direction, but frankly I hope to see action on Manton’s part. So far there has been a lot of deflection. I used to enthusiastically recommend Micro.blog; now I would only do so with a pretty huge caveat: take a look around, look at the small team, and look at how they handled this instance of criticism. Ask if your queer and trans pals would feel safe and welcome here.

Since fall 2023, I am no longer paying for a Micro.blog account. I did remove one cross-posting feature I was using with M.b. yesterday. I don’t know how long I’ll continue to syndicate there. In the same way WordPress introduced me to open source and I developed the skills to not rely on WP forever, I’m thankful to Manton and Micro.blog for introducing me to short-form microblogging, and finding ways to do that on my own.

**2025-01-23 Update:** I’m no longer syndicating my RSS to Micro.blog or linking to that platform. You should read [Hollie’s post](https://eilloh.net/2025/01/23/my-husband-asked-me-tonight.html). It’s much more articulate than anything else I can add right now. 

**2025-06-06 Update:** Happy Pride Month. I wish I had updated this post earlier in the year with a link to the post from Coyote Tracks, called "[The pressure to stay genteel](https://coyotetracks.org/blog/pressure-to-stay-genteel/)" too. It's a good read. Clearly, I'm still thinking about this situation from earlier this year. And from what I can see, literally nothing has changed much on the community management front over at M.b.
