Every year it is my annual tradition to inventory my reading for the calendar year. I started several books throughout the year, but only finished a few.

I ended 2024 and began 2025 saying I wanted to read more and "reclaim my attention"&mdash;whatever that means. Baseball Season is long, and so is Basketball Season, too. Sleep was precious. I am not going to beat myself up about the books I did not finish this year. There were several I started and had to put down. Even [the one about <i>The Onion</i>](https://www.npr.org/2025/03/23/nx-s1-5184428/funny-because-its-true-tells-the-history-of-satirical-paper-the-onion), I just couldn't get all the way through. Oh well.

We continued to read a lot of picture books, the little one and I. This year we got into <cite>The Magic School Bus</cite> series by Joanna Cole and Bruce Degen. The pair have a couple newer titles in the series that came out in the last decade. A bit nostalgic for me, and maybe a bit advanced for a preschooler. Some other kids' titles we both enjoyed were <cite>The Night Tent</cite> by Landis Blair and <cite>Sleepy, the Goodnight Buddy</cite> by Drew Daywalt and Scott Campbell.
