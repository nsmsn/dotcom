For March’s IndieWeb Book Club, I chose <cite>The Timeless Way of Building</cite> <small>(ISBN 9780195024029)</small>, a 1979 book on architecture by Christopher Alexander. This is part of a series that also includes <cite>A Pattern Language</cite> and <cite>The Oregon Experiment</cite>. 

On the PatternLanguage.com website, the [description of this volume](https://www.patternlanguage.com/bookstore/timeless-way-of-building.html) reads:

> There is one timeless way of building. It is thousands of years old, and the same today as it has always been. The great traditional buildings of the past, the villages and tents and temples in which man feels at home, have always been made by people who were very close to the center of this way. And as you will see, this way will lead anyone who looks for it to buildings which are themselves as ancient in their form as the trees and hills, and as our faces are.

The key concept of the book is what the author describes as <strong>“the quality without a name”</strong> and <cite>The Timeless Way of Building</cite>—along with Alexander’s other works—have inspired numerous architects, urbanists, artists, designers, and software developers. [Stewart Brand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewart_Brand) has called <cite>A Pattern Language</cite> “the best book in <cite>The Whole Earth Catalog</cite>.” 

I picked this one for the IndieWeb book club up due to the number of times I’ve seen it recommended and displayed on both physical and virtual book shelves of various creative types. I haven’t read it before myself, so this month should be interesting!

Notably, Alexander writes in the forward that you can read the 552 page volume in only an hour:

> What lies in this book is perhaps more important as a whole than in its details. If you only have an hour to spend on it, it makes much more sense to read the whole book roughly in that hour, than to read only the first two chapters in detail…If you read the read the beginning and end of every chapter, and the italic headlines that lie between them, turning the pages almost as fast as you can, you will be able to get the overall structure of the book in less than and hour. Then, if you want to go into detail, you will know where to go, but always in the context of the whole.

Hopefully you can find this through your local library, or perhaps a cheap used copy online. If you are in need of a PDF, someone else has [uploaded the whole thing to Are.na](https://www.are.na/block/19359072).
