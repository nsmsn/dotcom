June 2025 was my very first time hosting the [IndieWeb Carnival](https://indieweb.org/IndieWeb_Carnival). I received 36 entries total, which comes out to more than a one per day, so a lot of you had something to say about [the theme I came up with](/posts/2025-indieweb-carnival-take-two.html).

"Take Two" was about do-overs, second chances, and the possibility of time travel. But the vast majority of responses I got were pretty adamant that we all get one shot at life and most people would not take a chance for a do-over. I get it! I really enjoyed reading each entry and what follows are excerpts from each, **ordered alphabetically by domain name**. Editorially, I decided to ignore the common www subdomain, and also removed other hyperlinks in the blockquote exceprts.

Finally, if I missed any entries this month, I'm terribly sorry. Please email me at <a href="mailto:nick@nicksimson.com">nick@nicksimson.com</a> and I'll be sure to include your link. Thanks again to all who participated!

> I am comforted by the knowledge that whatever decision I made at any step in my life, it was the best decision given the information I had at the time. Trying to look back and drown in regrets and thoughts of what could have been will only slow me down on the way to the next decision.

Be sure to read Andrei's excellent followup, "<a href="https://andrei.xyz/post/five-years-and-twelve-minutes/">Five Years and Twelve Minutes</a>" too.

artlung.com: [“Take Two” as in Television Production](https://artlung.com/blog/2025/06/21/take-two-tv/).

<blockquote>
<p>Each of these were in their way radical changes in scene.</p>

<p>Each one a new take.</p>

<p>But more like a Television “Take Two.”</p>

<p>Not really a Film “Take Two.”</p>

<p>New scene. New script. New setting. New actors. New lighting. New special effects.</p>

> Would I want to have another chance at running a tech review blog? No. I wish I didn't treat my blog like a side hustle. I wish I didn't believe all those websites telling me that my blog should have a niche to stand out amongst the many blogs already existing. I wish I didn't expect myself to produce journalist-quality writing all the time and let myself make mistakes.

blog.helenchong.omg.lol: [Take Two: Rediscovering Web Design](https://blog.helenchong.omg.lol/en/posts/2025-06-26-indieweb-carnival-take-two/).

> The further I learned web development and tech, the more I realised that pursuing a graphic design career was the biggest mistake I made for my life. While I appreciate that my background in graphic design provided design skills that allowed me to transition to web design and web development, I deeply regretted my teenage self's ignorance for assuming graphic design work involved web design as well.

britthub.co.uk: [Take Two](https://britthub.co.uk/take-two/).

Britt took the inital prompts I provided and went to town answering all of them!

> OK. Those are some good questions. Honestly I’ve done a lot of looking back on this blog recently, reviewing what got me to where I am. It’s been healing. I do worry that I’ve been a bit stuck in review mode but it has allowed me mental space to get creating new things again.

<hr />

christiantietze.de: [Emacs Carnival: Take Two](https://christiantietze.de/posts/2025/06/emacs-carnival-2025-06-take-two/).

> We usually don’t nail “it” on our first try – <code>init.el</code> bancruptcy; refactoring hacky Emacs Lisp code; leaving Emacs only to come back englightened much later; running two Emacsens in parallel. There are plenty of possible second takes when it comes to Emacs!

Christian reached out to me early in the month, asking if he could use the theme I came up with for his own community blogging carnival. This was a bit unexpected, but I said yes, and encouraged the Emacs bloggers to send me their posts as well.

<hr />

cosmicflow.space: [Take Two - A new Start](https://cosmicflow.space/take-two-a-new-start/).

> One thing I have learned while making this website is that second, third, and fourth takes are important, each time you try something again from scratch you are not starting it from zero, each time you have a new perspective on things, you have new skills you can use. Even if you do not end up meeting your original goals the knowledge you gain is invaluable because _if you live long enough you are bound to use everything you have ever learned_.

<hr />

dahlstrand.net: [My Experimental June](https://dahlstrand.net/2025/06/08/my-experimental-june.html).

> I performed The Great Unfollowing a couple of days before June started, so I’ve had about a week and a half without a social timeline now. So far, I do not miss it at all. Maybe it’s because I still hear from most folks via their blogs. It’s just a little quieter. Calmer. I like it!

<hr />

davidized.com: [IndieWeb Carnival: Take Two](https://davidized.com/2025/06/30/take-two/).

> I’ve been doing some thinking lately after listening to Corey Doctrow’s Who Broke the Internet? podcast about what I want the internet to be, and how I can make an effort to create that in my own little corner of the web. Going through old posts, I was reminded of what I consider the golden age of the web and blogging when people were still mostly producing content on their own sites or on smaller communities rather than being consolidated onto the large platforms like Facebook, Twitter, etc.

<hr />

esgeroth.org: [Take Two](https://www.esgeroth.org/log/entry/2760).

> So no, I don't want a Take Two for my own life. But is there a second take we can offer the young people (and especially young men) who are growing up as awkward and even more online than I was? Who are up against algorithms designed to keep them scrolling, no matter how harmful the content becomes? There's definitely a terrifying ecosystem pulling them into the hard right and it's an issue we need to tackle. But I also wonder what we can do to make sure we aren't also pushing them that way—through mockery or indifference or not offering them meaning. 

<hr />

flirora.xyz: [Reflections on “Pointed and pointfree glossing”](https://flirora.xyz/posts/reflections-pointfree.html).

> Over four years ago, I published “Pointed and pointfree glossing”, referring to how some conlang lexica show explicit markers for the arguments of a verb and others don’t. About two months ago, I republished it on my new site with improved formatting. However, I have some more stuff about this subject that I want to write futher about.

<hr />

gregnewman.io: [Emacs Take Two (Eglot)](https://gregnewman.io/blog/emacs-take-two/).

> I started using Emacs about 20 years ago. From the start I was heavily involved in the Emacs IRC channel and the Org mode mailing list. I contributed the refresh of the Org mode logo to Dr. Carsten Dominik and the community as a small thank you for such a great package. All my notes were stored in Org mode files, along with my task lists. For development I used Elpy for Python and Webmode for anything HTML and Javascript. Elpy was good enough for me back then. Webmode was just ok but had a lot of problems with javascript. I jumped over to LSP mode pretty early and that solved a lot of problems with Python but it was a pain to configure and broke at the most inconvenient times. I was frustrated a lot of the time I was trying to work.

krrd.ing: [take two - nairobi](https://krrd.ing/blog/take-two-nairobi/).

> As weird as it was tracing steps were I once lived, it was good to see familiar sites and faces. It was good to see their evolution. With a hint of sadness it was good to realize how amazing our time spent there was but that it was equally good that we are on to new things now.

<hr />

manuelmoreale.com: [IndieWeb Carnival: Take Two](https://manuelmoreale.com/indieweb-carnival-take-two).

> There are many, many things I wish were different but going back and doing something again to get a different outcome doesn’t look appealing to me. Because however imperfect, however messy and unsatisfying, my life is my life.

<hr />

marisabel.nl: [Take Two - Starting Over Again and Again](https://marisabel.nl/public/blog/Take_Two_-_Starting_Over_Again_and_Again).

> I am pretty sure I am not the only one to write about how Corona forced us to start over. But when I think about starting over — having done it once before — this feels more like a take three. I’ve always thought it’s akin to a merry-go-round. Sometimes you fall with the force of the spin and have to choose another horse to begin again. Or perhaps it’s like a train, where you’re suddenly forced to get off and wait for the next. There are no second chances in life — but three, and four, and five — and as many as you are brave enough to see.

<hr />

martinhaagen.se: [The Trip From Rome](https://www.martinhaagen.se/posts/the-trip-from-rome/).

> Would I want to go back and change something in my life? Most of what has shaped and led me through life has been coincidence. It was a mistake that I ended up in the career I did—at the time, I wanted to be a sheet metal worker like my dad, but I ended up in a theoretical high school program that eventually led to a master’s degree. I got to work with coding and computers, which I loved, simply because I was in the right place at the right time. I got married, had kids, got divorced, and then had another child. I don’t regret any of it. I would never want a second take on this life. It’s all part of who I am today and who I will become in the future.

<hr />

mike.hostetlerhome.com: [Emacs: Take 2](https://mike.hostetlerhome.com/emacs-take-2).

> So why I did switch from Vim to Emacs? Well fast-forward some years and I had switched positions and my needs changed. I don't remember exactly what happened but VimScript was in it's infancy and it wasn't quite living up to my expectations. And then I remember opening several files at once, trying to compare them and Vim wasn't cutting it. I think I had been seeing smart people talk about Emacs and it could do what I wanted. So, I decided to take a week and go cold-turkey on it.

<hr />

notes.neatnik.net: [The space between](https://notes.neatnik.net/2025/06/the-space-between).

> I know that regret is generally unproductive, but reflection is important. There’s something useful about being able to look in the rearview mirror to see what we could have done differently. When I think about the do-overs I’ve wished for in life, a consistent theme is the realization that I didn’t really use the space between stimulus and response. That I didn’t spend the time needed to choose the right response. I can’t take back things that I’ve said or done, but I can use those regrets as fuel for a better outcome next time.

<hr />

odonnellweb.com: [Would You Take the Do-over](https://odonnellweb.com/pelican/do-over.html).

>  If you buy the multiverse construct where every decision we make creates a new timeline, it seems like it would be completely impossible to reliably repeat history. For one thing, doesn't the mere act of going back in history change the timeline, not to mention all the other decisions you'll make differently?

This was the first submission I had emailed to me, but it was originally written three years ago. I included it becuase it was fitting and this month was all about revisiting the past.

<hr />

readbeanicecream.surge.sh: [Take Two](https://readbeanicecream.surge.sh/2025/06/16/take-two/).

> They congratulated me on my success. I thanked them, but made a light-hearted joke about my "dozens of readers." They laughed, but what they said next, caught me off guard, again. "Where I am from, we have saying: 'Before a man dies he should plant a tree, have a child, and write a book.' And you have done all three. You have left your mark on the world; helped to shape it and that is something to be proud of." I smiled and expressed my gratitude.

reillyspitzfaden.com: [IndieWeb Carnival: Take Two](https://reillyspitzfaden.com/posts/2025/06/indieweb-carnival-take-two/).

> As I program and patch my own electronic music tools and setups, I find myself in the exact same position of making music tools instead of actually making music. For my “take two” I'm throwing out a bunch of material (or rather putting it in a safe place to draw from later) and restarting this piece with a different approach. I'll discuss how I seem to have ended up here and some recent thoughts about composition that I'm hoping can take me out of this rut.

<hr />

rishikeshs.com: [The Hobby I Forgot I Had](https://rishikeshs.com/the-hobby-i-forgot/). 

<blockquote>
<p>It’s strange to admit, but of all the things I’ve done in life, the one I genuinely wish I could have a take two on is my old sand collection hobby.</p>

<p>I mean if you think of it, isn’t it the perfect souvenir? A piece of land, a piece of geography, with stories of asteroids and dinosaurs and hunters and war, of rocks weathering and continents shifting, embedded in every grain.</p>

<hr />

rossabaker.com: [Take Two: An Infinite Series](https://rossabaker.com/blog/take-two-an-infinite-series/).

> I could only think of a lesson learned in the first of those stints: There’s nothing so permanent as an interim solution.

sachachua.com:

1. [Making and re-making: fabric is tuition](https://sachachua.com/blog/2025/06/making-and-re-making-fabric-is-tuition/).
2. [Thinking about time travel with the Emacs text editor, Org Mode, and backups](https://sachachua.com/blog/2025/06/thinking-about-time-travel-with-the-emacs-text-editor-and-org-mode/).
3. [The wobble is not the obstacle, it's the way](https://sachachua.com/blog/2025/06/the-wobble-is-not-the-obstacle-it-s-the-way/).

So Sacha responded to the IndieWeb and Emacs carnivals not once, not twice, but three times! I particularly loved this quote from the first entry Sacha sent me: 

> Sewing is becoming more enjoyable and less stressful. I worry less about making mistakes because I've learned how to recover from many of them. Sometimes something's more of a loss, like that lavender floor-length cotton dress with a split organza overskirt that she wore a couple of times before it was declared too uncomfortable, or the scraps that she cuts up when trying to fashion a dress for her doll. That's fine, fabric is tuition for learning.

sarahgebauer.com: [No take two](https://www.sarahgebauer.com/desk/no-take-two/). 

> If I did the take two and changed the past in 2023 or even went back to 2003 and stayed in US, I wouldn't be the person whom I found. Those Sarahs are hypothetical versions of myself. They are not here.

sarajaksa.eu: [IndieWeb Carnival June 2025: No Take Two](https://sarajaksa.eu/2025/06/indieweb-carnival-june-2025-no-take-two/).

> Reminds me of the joke about the day in the year to celebrate the galaxy's birthday. Since even the molecules that make our planet had such a different path, they would all show the different age and the different day in a year they would think it happened. Making everyday the 'celebrate the galaxy birthday' day.

sentfrom.me: [June 2025 IndieWeb Carnival, "Take Two:" The Spokane Option](https://sentfrom.me/june-2025-indieweb-carnival-take-two-the-spokane-option/).

> However, there's an even bigger what-if scenario to consider for my life, something I'l call the Spokane Option. What could have happened had I taken it, and how would my life had changed? Would it be better in whatever definition that word could mean, or possibly even worse off? Let's find out.

<hr />

skippy.net: [Take Two](https://skippy.net/take-two).

> After writing the above, and re-reading it a few times, I think I would eagerly take a do-over to make someone else’s life better, even if I didn’t really learn the right lessons from that experience at the time. Harm reduction has a compounding effect on the world, and making someone else’s life safer, happier, better is important!

<hr />

starbreaker.org: [No Remorse, No Regrets, and No Need for Second Chances](https://starbreaker.org/grimoire/entries/no-second-chances/index.html).

> Of course, all of this about going back and choosing otherwise is mere fantasy. I can’t unring the bell. Time’s riptide sweeps us all out to sea, and none may swim against it. I cannot ford the same river twice because I am not the man I had been, and the river is not what it had been either. The decisions I made remade me in turn, and every tear I shed over the past is a waste of good suffering.

<hr />

tangiblelife.net: [Take Two](https://tangiblelife.net/take-two).

> Also, as I’ve written about before, this blog is a bit of a “take two” for my online writing. Consolidating my writing just this one blog (vs. three separate ones) has been a great feeling. Sometimes a second take isn’t due to a mistake made during the first take. Sometimes the second take is about gaining new perspective by trying something again or doing it differently.

<hr />

thefrugalgamer.net: [Take Two: Customizing My Spaces](https://www.thefrugalgamer.net/blog/2025/06/07/take-two-customizing-my-spaces/).

> When people are allowed to customize the things they use, they frequently come up with ideas that the original creators never could have foreseen, and even the least artistic of us are capable of some amazing creativity. Looking through custom desktop pictures is one of my favorite things to do because, even if I wouldn’t use most configurations, each of them is so incredibly unique and suited to the person it’s intended for.

thoughts.uncountable.uk: [Take Two](https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/take-two/).

<blockquote>
<p>I feel like I’m on Take Two of my fifties, with the Take One being the continuation of my forties which didn’t actually happen.</p>

<p>In August 2019, a couple of months before my 51st birthday, I walked home from work for the last time. After 29 years of continuous employment, I had a sense that I wanted to traverse my fifties on my own terms.</p>

winther.sysctl.dk: [Take two: rewriting a system from scratch](https://winther.sysctl.dk/take-two-rewriting-a-system-from-scratch/).

> What came to mind for me was something from my professional work as a software developer. As I am sure most people who have worked on larger development projects know, most things could get better if we could rewrite it from scratch.

<hr />

yordi.me: [Take Two at the Harbor](https://yordi.me/take-two-at-the-harbor/).

> People often speak of the "eureka effect"—one of those thought streams that comes out of nowhere, in the shower or on a long walk. A moment where all the loose ends suddenly tie together. If such a thing truly exists, then that’s exactly what happened to me on that terrace in the harbor of Nice. Not the place you’d expect a revelation like that to happen, assuming you’d expect it at all.
