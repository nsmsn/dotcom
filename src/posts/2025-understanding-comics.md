In my youth, I lived and breathed cartoons, comics, and animation. Like many children I learned to read through Dr. Suess' iconic picture books. Once I started reading and writing, I also found myself illustrating my own stories. Some early memories with cartoons and comics include painting the yellow submarine from the Beatles animated film in art class, and turning in a comics panel based on <i>Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH</i> as a book report in elementary school<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>.

I had a few of the Calvin Hobbes book collections as well as scrapbooks of other favorite Sunday strips I was clipping from the newspaper myself. My parents bought me the [earliest Wallace and Gromit short film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Grand_Day_Out) on VHS, many dollar store compilations of animation from the 1930s and 40s, as well as [Bruce Blitz's 'How to Draw Cartoons'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sP6AWMNuq9o) tape from 1987. As a youngster with a bicycle and a library card, I was hungry to get my hands on every book that was related to comics or animation.

I first encountered Scott McCloud's <i>Understanding Comics</i> in the library as a teenager in the early 2000s. I didn’t yet know “graphic design” was a thing, but “cartoonist” was still an aspirational career for me then. The book has stayed with me. I've had McCloud's book listed on my [Library web page](/library.html) for the last five years, but I have not actually re-read this book in nearly 25 years. It happens to be this month's selection for the [IndieWeb Book Club](https://indieweb.org/IndieWeb_Book_Club), [hosted by Joe "Artlung" Crawford](https://artlung.com/understandingcomics-ibc/). So I eagerly put a hold on the title and picked it up from the library last week.

<i>Understanding Comics</i> begins with the concept of visual literacy, and each chapter builds upon the previous one, exploring concepts like abstraction, time, motion, artistic movements, art history, and other media&nbsp;all through comic devices: panels of sequential art and hand-lettered word balloons. This book is still as timely as written in 1993.

  <p>Large panel: Scott swims though a sea of abstacted icons. "By drawing <strong>borders</strong> around the vocabulary of comics, I hope I haven't made it seem smaller than it is. Comics artists have a <strong>universe</strong> of icons to choose from! And it's expanding all the time! Society is inventing <strong>new</strong> symbols regularly, just as comics artists do."</p>
  
  <p>A smaller panel shows a human head full of recognizable symbols and logos, like the no smoking sign, the olympics icon, and the Toyota vehicle logo. "Ours is an increasingly symbol-oriented culture."</p>

McCloud's cartoon avatar self-portrait is surrounded by and swimming through icons, many of which may as well be [emoji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoji), which are ubiquitous today but were only beginning to be developed and far short of any kind of standardization until the 2000s. 

I am thoroughly enjoying the re-read of this book, and rediscovering why it made such an impact on me at a young age. I'm nearly finished, but I just had to get this review in this weekend. There's still time this month to [pick up a copy at your library](https://search.worldcat.org/title/Understanding-comics-:-the-invisible-art/oclc/30351626) or [read it online via the Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/understanding-comics) if you wish to participate in the IndieWeb book club.

Another excerpt stands out, describing comics as a form of _new media_:

  <p>Panel 1: A boy in a word balloon shirt tosses a ball in the background. Scott says: "The art form of comics is many centuries old, but it's perceived as a recent invention and suffers the curse of all new media."</p>

  <p>Panel 2: bald bearded figures in robes representing literature, theatre, painting surround the little comics boy. Scott: "The curse of being judged by the standards of the old."</p>
  
  <p>Panel 3: Ever since the invention of the written word, new media have been misunderstood. A prehistoric man says to another man carving into a tablet: "Careful Jacob! If you keep doing this, you'll stop using your memory!"</p>
  
  <p>Panel 4: Each new medium begins its life by imitating its predecessors. Many early movies were like filmed stage plays, much early television was like radio with pictures or reduced movies.</p>

  <p>Panel 5: Scott has several pedestals representing art forms behind him, with two sequential comics panels on a lower pedestal than the others. "Far too many comics creators have no higher goal than to match the achievements of other media, and view any chance to work in othe rmedia as a step up."</p>
  
  <p>Panel 6: And again, as long as we view comics as a genre of writing or a style of graphic art this attitude may never disappear.</p>

As I read this book again in 2025, I can't help but think of the web, the medium I primarily work in today. It's still a young medium, only thirty-something years old, and in its very infancy when <i>Understanding Comics</i> first came out. McCloud did write  a follow-up, called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinventing_Comics"><i>Reinventing Comics</i></a> in 2000, and includes many examples of comics artists using the web and digital technology to advance the art form further. I read this book as well as a teen, and I'd be interested in revisiting that title as well. My memory is a bit fuzzy, but I remember a lot about the web page as an _infinite canvas_ standing out in my baby-web-developer brain.

Significantly, McCloud spends a lot of energy in his work talking about comics as _participatory communication_. As a reader, you are filling in the space between panels with your own sensory imagination (a concept McCloud calls _closure_). The web is similar as an interactive medium. There are very few "passive" websites these days, and that most powerful element of the web, the hyperlink helps you uncover entire worlds within and beyond sites.

I also think about how rapidly visual communication has evolved in the Internet Age, in the thirty years since we got an <code>img</code> tag added to HTML. This year's backlash to the Cracker Barrel logo redesign may have been manufactured, but it builds upon a recent history of people using the web and social media to react, remix and dunk on corporate redesigns (The Gap and the University of California rebrands were earlier, more organic examples). A whole book could be written on memes, which are often visual (and increasingly audiovisual) and encourage a user-generated remixing. Today someone without drawing skills can even prompt an AI program like ChatGPT to create a set of comic panels for them, drawn in either a soulless generic style or one that apes a recognizable artist's hand like Bill Watterson's or Hayao Miyazaki's. Of course, I don't mean to reduce the visual language of today's digital culture to remixes, memes, and GenAI slop. I just think of these three things as developments that wouldn't have taken shape quickly without a web of connected information and users with access to free and cheap tools. 

McCloud uses the terms "comics artist" and "comics creator" interchangably through his work in 1993, and that word "creator" is very interesting to me. I've listened to a few of Taylor Lorenz's "Power User" podcasts and noticed how frequently she uses that word to describe someone who produces and publishes digital content. A _creator_ is kind of the ultimate word for someone who makes culture<sup><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup>, more than "artist", "author", "actor", "writer", "blogger", or that detested term "influencer". I think of the term _world-building_: a comics artist creating the settings and characters for stories to unfold. Or God in the Book of Genesis, giving shape to the planet and its oceans and land masses, plants and creatures. Or any number of creation myths, for that matter.

I don't know who out there is still using terms like _[new media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_media)_ or even _[visual communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_communication)_. Both feel like aging, academic, and outdated terms. To me, at least. I think we will someday even drop the "social" in "social media." The web is news and comics. Blogs and conversation. Art and games you can participate in. Live television you make and react to. And probably other stuff yet to be invented.

Scott McCloud titled his book after Marshall McLuhan's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Understanding_Media"><i>Understanding Media</i></a> (1964), about thirty years after that book made a splash. Perhaps it's time for someone to do the difficult work of writing an "Understanding the Web." Despite [all the efforts to declare the web dead](https://zeldman.com/2025/10/25/receipts-a-brief-list-of-prominent-articles-proclaiming-the-death-of-the-web/), it's still a young medium, and still very misunderstood.
