Following November’s <a href="https://artlung.com/understandingcomics-ibc/">IndieWeb Book Club pick <cite>Understanding Comics</cite></a>, December’s <a href="https://mattl.status.lol/693857e8292e1">IndieWeb Movie Club invites us to watch <cite>Ghost World</cite></a>, a film adaptation of a comic. I borrowed a copy of the [Criterion Collection DVD](https://www.criterion.com/films/28687-ghost-world) from my local library. I had been aware of both the film and graphic novel, but never seen or read either before. So my first viewing was this month. I also watched it a second time with the commentary, as well as the other DVD&nbsp;extras.

The film opens with “[Jaan Pehechaan Ho](https://youtu.be/nOAsaehfPrk)”, a flamboyant, energetic dance number from the 1965 Bollywood musical <cite>Gumnaam</cite>. The performers in this movie within a movie are wearing masks as they sing and dance. Masks—both literal and figurative—are going be prominent in this feature, exploring identity and authenticity in the transition from adolescence to adulthood. As the music plays, we peer into the windows of a mundane suburban neighborhood lit by the bluish glow of a television set inside each room. In one cluttered bedroom we see a teenage girl in her graduation robes shaking her head to the&nbsp;music.

We are introduced to Enid (Thora Birch) and Rebecca (Scarlett Johansson), best friends on graduation day. The pair enjoy their time together quietly ridiculing their peers and the citizens of the nameless town they reside in. The two don’t have plans after graduating, beyond working in the service economy and saving enough from their jobs to rent an apartment together. Enid flunks art class and has to re-take it during the summer in order to graduate. After playing a cruel prank on a lonely middle aged record collector named Seymour (Steve Buscemi), Enid and Rebecca end up following him to his home. Over the course of the summer, the two friends drift apart: Rebecca starts working at a corporate coffee shop and starts buying housewares at Pottery Barn; while Enid befriends the eccentric and adrift Seymour and entangles herself in his&nbsp;life.

There's another establishing shot early in the film: a busy strip of big box retailers, chain motels and fast food restaurants that was meant to show how anonymous the setting is. This could be Anywhere, USA. Of course the city of Los Angeles put up big “LA” banners on all the street poles the night before this location was filmed, and it was too expensive at the time to erase these artifacts from the shot. I'm reminded of the different places I’ve lived and how various strip malls are such a featureless feature of life in so much of the United States. I recall checking out a library book on urbanism as a seventeen year old, and identifying the poor design of suburban life as a source of my own alienation and isolation at that&nbsp;age.

The element of teenagers visiting (and torturing) each other at their jobs rings true to my experience as a young person. I also felt like my high school would have totally welcomed the sponsorship of Tropicana and Dunkin' Donuts for our graduation ceremony. The theme of growing up and inevitably “selling out” is resonant, as I remember a bit what it was like to be a teen, but at the same time find myself closer to the adult characters in age. Bob Balaban is great in his scenes as Enid's father, trying despartely to connect to the daughter who seems repulsed by him. Illeana Douglas is expertly cast as a pretentious and broken art instructor. From watching the DVD extras its clear she brought so much of her own ideas to developing this comedic&nbsp;character.

As Enid, Thora Birch is a force of nature. We see her try on different personas through fashion and eyewear choices, and sabotaging her own future in the course of this pivotal summer. As an adult man, I desperately wanted Steve Buscemi's Seymour to establish some appropriate boundaries with his new friend&mdash;but that would have been an entirely different film. I found myself relating to Scarlett Johansson's character with her jealousy and disgust at her best friend's pursuit of this older man. I loved the surreal, ambiguous ending. I've since read the numerous interpretations, and I don't think there is a correct or incorrect way to interpret it. Perhaps my feelings will change after reading the comics&nbsp;next.

From what I understand, Terry Zwigoff did not set out to make shot-for-drawing adaptation of the comics by Daniel Clowes. Only a few shots in the film are directly inspired by the pages and panels in the graphic novel. Clowes co-wrote the screenplay with Zwigoff and was heavily involved in the film's production, though. In the DVD commentary Clowes talks a bit about seeing the graphic novel and film as distinct, separate creations with some continuity between the Enid and Rebecca characters. I found this particularly interesting, as the cartoonist was writing both a "film Enid" and a "comics&nbsp;Enid".

I also gather the film is more from Enid's perspective whereas the graphic novel is mostly from Rebecca's point of view. As the Seymour character was a creation for the film (and Steve Buscemi), the comics explore the Rebecca/Enid relationship much more deeply than the film does, and there are even queer readings into the intimacy of this friendship. That, plus the clumsy handling of a racist image plot device makes me eager to put this film version aside and explore the source material a bit&nbsp;more. 

Should there be a <cite>Ghost World</cite> reboot? A new cast could bring the cynical world of Enid and Rebecca to life again (another film? A mini-series?). Would Daniel Clowes ever entrust his characters in the hands of a new writing team? I'd particularly love to see what someone who actually lived as a teenage girl could do with these characters. Before I'm ready for it, I'll have a teenager of my own, and I wonder what media will resonate with&nbsp;her.

My final verdict on <cite>Ghost World</cite>:  a compelling story with deeply flawed characters where nobody ends up happy in the end. Is anyone still making movies like&nbsp;this?
