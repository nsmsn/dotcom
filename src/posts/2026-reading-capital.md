I recently borrowed the 2024 edition of <cite>Capital: Critique of Political Economy, Volume 1</cite>, by Karl Marx from the library. [This latest edition](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691190075/capital) was translated by Paul Reitter and edited by Paul North with Paul Reitter.

From the foreword by Wendy Brown: 

> Mainstream social science identifies capitalism as an economic system based in markets organized by free competition and spurred by the profit motive. But where is the power to make and destroy worlds in this formulation, to draw everything into its orbit, to permeate and transform every physical and psychic cell of earthly life? For Marx, the thinness and superficiality of the mainstream account not only shrouds capital’s power and plunder but ignores its conditions of existence, the social relations constituting and constituted by it, the protean orders it creates, transforms, destroys, abandons. Indeed, what Marx’s work forever challenged was not only capitalism’s exploitative nature and commodifying effects, for which he is readily known, but the reduction of economics to markets and thus to a domain of knowledge and practice imagined to be independent of social relations, histories, laws, family forms, politics, policing, religion, language, representation, and psyche.

I've never read <cite>Capital</cite> before. I know how influential this book is (putting it mildly). I've been in the workforce for half my life at this point. I was in a labor union for some of those years. I've read books and papers by numerous scholars who themselves identify as 'Marxist', but I haven't engaged with the source material before. I wasn't assigned any Marx in college, but I'm vaguely familiar with excerpts of his work from other reading and media. Yes, I've already read the [Wikipedia entry for this book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Das_Kapital).

By reading <cite>Capital</cite>, I hope to close what feels like a huge gap in my reading, and more importantly engage with these ideas and understand Marx's influence. I am quite interested in questions about social democracy, political economy, the labor movement here and around the world. I feel like a novice for not having read this foundational text.

From Paul North's editor's introduction:

> You will need great powers of thought to read <cite>Capital</cite>, but the logic Marx wants you to employ doesn't reside in the mind or in a special realm accessible only to thinking; in fact, the logic that organizes societal life under the capital system is immant to that life and accessible first and foremost in your own practices... When you buy or sell something; when you got to work in the morning; when you invest in a mutual fund; when you get laid off or switch careers; when you pay an employee or stockpile money in a cashbox or a bank, you act constantly with regard to the logic immanent to our form of interactions. Look no further than your everyday experiences.

If you're interested, I invite you to read Volume 1 of <cite>Capital</cite> with me this year. Even if you've read it before! Feel free to pick any edition, any translation... you can even [download an ebook for free](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/download/). Just let me know if you start reading this in 2026.

**2026-01-30 Update**: I picked up David Harvey's <a href="https://www.versobooks.com/products/803-a-companion-to-marx-s-capital"><cite>A Companion To Marx's Capital</cite></a>, which I am planning to read after finishing each chapter. The Harvey book is great so far. He's been teaching <cite>Capital</cite> in a university setting for several decades, and it is helpful to have such a guide for reading this on my own for the first time. I successfully finished chapter one (The Commodity), by the way.
