'Tis the season to look back at various data I kept track of for a full year, including music data. On Jan. 1 I got reports from scrobbling services [Last.fm](https://www.last.fm/user/nsmsn/listening-report/year/2025) and [Libre.fm](https://libre.fm/user/nsmsn/recap/2025), and I thought it'd be interesting to look at both. 

I'll go alphabetical and start with Last.fm, which informs me I spent 42 days and 10 hours listening to music. Of the 1,764 artists I listened to, 65% were new artists. However, my number one most listend to artist was again Yo La Tengo, surprising noone. Last.fm recorded me listening to them 343 times, putting me in their top 0.46% of fans worldwide.

I listened to <cite>Versions of Modern Performance</cite> by Horsegirl a lot this year, mostly in anticipation of <cite>Phonetics On and On</cite>, and then afterward, because it is still a good one! I bought both Horsegirl albums on vinyl this year. They are solid albums.

I only listened to Bruce Springsteen's <cite>Tracks II</cite> once, but at eighty-something songs it clocked in as one of my top albums, both in Apple Music's Recap and Last.fm's Playback.

Last.fm recorded **15,306** scrobbles for me in 2025, and my longest streak was 66 consecutive days (not of continuous listening, but days I didn't miss a scrobble).

Libre.fm recorded **7,771** songs, or approx. 453 hours of music. Here's my top ten artists of 2025:

1. Men I Trust (126 plays)
2. Peel Dream Magazine (106 plays)
3. Horsegirl (87 plays)
4. Erik Satie (77 plays)
5. Cate Le Bon (76 plays)
6. Sharp Pins (76 plays)
7. Yo La Tengo (68 plays)
8. Jim O'Rourke (61 plays)
9. Dan Reeder (59 plays)
10. Glyders (57 plays)

The top track Libre.fm recorded for me was "[Alien](https://insecuremen.bandcamp.com/track/alien)" by Insecure Men. A standout track from an album that didn't quite click with me this year, but I liked it as a single.

There seems to be a bit of discrepancy between my scrobbles on Last.fm versus Libre.fm. I think its mainly that scrobbling is more frictionless in a desktop web browser versus iOS with Apple Music. Stuff needs to be in your Apple Music library to register on mobile as well. This saved me from having a lot of music from <cite>Doc McStuffins</cite> and <cite>Gabby's Dollhouse</cite> show up in my Last.fm listening data.

I think my use of both scrobbling services will be mostly in sync as long as I continue to use [Webscrobbler](https://webscrobbler.com/) as my primary source. But I'm not going to try to obsess over that. I really like using Libre.fm, and just set started [donating a bit of cash each month](https://libre.fm/donate.php), because I want this to be around. Last.fm is owned by Paramount, and frankly doesn't need any more money from me.

I switched streaming from Apple Music to Qobuz toward the end of the year. A pal shared a two-month free trial, which I'm currently in the middle of, and enjoying. I also listen to a lot of music on Bandcamp, and occasionally buy music from there. I tried to keep up with new releases throughout the whole year with [Record Club](https://record.club/nsmsn).

It's too early for me to pick favorites, and that is the relationship I have with recorded music. My top five albums currently are all more than twenty years old at this point. There may be releases I forgot to put here, as well as some I slept on, so I reserve the right to edit this list as needed in the coming weeks.

Then there's the matter of live music. Because I have a little kid, I do not get out to see much live music these days. But I'd like to get out to at least one show in 2026. Ratboys is playing here in March.

A lot of great stuff came out in 2025. I was still discovering old gems this year too. Maybe this roundup post will become an annual tradition.
