I decided to switch things up and use a display font for the main headings (<code>h1</code> in HTML) on my website. This display font is a fun one called [Dinger](https://www.dingbat.xyz/l/dinger), created by Jacob Cummings, aka [Dingbat](https://dingbat.co/studio/). From what I can glean off the web, Jake is from Connecticut (but presently in Austin, Texas) and is a Mets fan, judging by the Dingbat specimen.

From the Dinger page: 

> Dinger is a slab serif typeface inspired by baseballâ€™s historic Tuscan wood type combined with bold display fonts popularized in the 60s and 70s. Think of it as a mashup of Cooper Black and a Tuscan wood type.

The Tuscan style of fonts is a style of lettering I've long been fascinated with. Beyond my Mets' visitor jerseys, similar lettering can be seen on the [Boston Red Sox home and away jerseys](https://www.sportslogos.net/logos/list_by_team/53/Boston-Red-Sox-Logos/). You might call this lettering style ["Circus" if you cheer on the Kansas Jayhawks](https://uni-watch.com/2024/10/03/ku-jayhawks-unveil-new-white-hoops-uniform-bring-back-circus-font/).

I am not an impulse buyer of fonts. I came across Dinger weeks ago and couldn't get it out of my head. While it screams "baseball" to me, it doesn't look like other baseball fonts out there, or even [other Tuscan display fonts](https://fontsinuse.com/search?terms=tuscan&page=1). The Cooper Black comparison is actually quite telling. I fell in love with [Dan Sinker's website design](https://dansinker.com/) using Cooper Black (and [Gelica](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/gelica)) the moment I saw it. 

I took note of Tracy Durnell's site when she [updated her web fonts](https://tracydurnell.com/2025/02/07/weeknotes-feb-1-7-2025/) earlier this year. There is a neat fantastical quality to [Texturina](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Texturina), which Tracy is using for headings. Its a font you don't see used very often. I've wanted to use a unique display font for [Version Six](/posts/2025-version-six.html) and waffled between [Fraunces](https://fraunces.undercase.xyz/) and [Platypi](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Platypi) for some time, but neither quite felt like _my look_.

After purchasing Dinger and downloading the files, I gave it a try in <code>localhost</code>, bumped up the size a bit (If you're gonna go display, **go Display**) and was really pleased with the way it looked. In both sentence and title case, the roundedness and scalloped edges are just the right amount of _weird_ for my personal site. 

I have treated my site as an open playground, and this new display type invites more play. I'm pretty happy with my type sizes and scales, but maybe I could introduce some color themes down the road to really let this display type shine. At the same time, I'm asking myself if this fun, wacky typeface undermines my tone when I occasionally [write about serious issues](/posts/2025-american-fantasy.html)? I'm going to sit with that question, and try not shy away from any topic I want to write about.

In the meantime, I don't know if the 2025 Mets will hang on to their Wild Card spot and make the playoffs next month. Here's hoping my recent typographic shift manifests even more _dingers_ for this last week of September.
