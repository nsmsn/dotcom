<p>Second person birds<br/> 
Stored up in a turquoise milk crate<br/> 
Heavy-handed heartache<br/> 
Beat three times<br/> 
A pearl snap pocket flap</p>

<p>Headed for the heights<br/>
Hankerin’ for a cafe tray<br/>
The screenplay screams out<br/>
for a change of scene<br/>
Find a way out, rainbow trout</p>

<p>Second person birds<br/>
Memory in the third degree<br/>
Trial, denial, the shape of a poem<br/>
The indie web?<br/>
I do not know ‘em</p>

## About this poem

This is my contribution to the [IndieWeb Blogging Carnival](https://indieweb.org/IndieWeb_Carnival) for September. The phrase "[second person birds](https://toground.link/second-person-birds/)" conjured up the image of [Joseph Cornell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Cornell)'s "[bird boxes](https://birdyrevolution.blogspot.com/2011/02/joseph-cornell-art.html)". Thinking of these art assemblages, I thought of creating my own collage of words, some based off fragments of poetic imagery collected in my notebook.
