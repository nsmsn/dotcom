I spend a lot of time thinking about what better collaboration looks like between design and development teams, and got to see a bit of effective collaboration in action at work&nbsp;today. 

A couple weeks ago I presented a medium fidelity prototype of a new home page with a scrolling demo and a few interactions. Today we reviewed a more fleshed out proof-of-concept by the dev team introducing some subtle animations and new controls in the CMS we use. Yes, we are baking a few more _design tools_ into our CMS to handle things like layouts and landing pages better. It's exciting, and a little frightening.

I've long believed design and development can work together like a friendly game of table tennis: volleying designs and protoptypes and proof-of-concepts back and forth into higher levels of completion, reaching a more finished product. This is not my original idea. Here's [Brad Frost in 2013](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/development-is-design/):

> As multi-device Web design quickly becomes the norm, the throw-it-over-the-fence style of creating websites is going to be increasingly difficult. The modern Web design process requires intense collaboration between designers and front-end developers. Real collaboration and communication are difficult, but we must get over that awkwardness in order to overcome the design/development divide.

This way of working is a bit _squishier_ than delivering a super high fidelity Sketch or Figma file for developer handoff and waiting a week or two to review in testing. It was really great to see our dev team's own creative approach to problem solving and hear their recommendations. They gave our product and design team a lot to work with to provide feedback, and in turn this helps me write better annotations for the final&nbsp;designs. 

Conversation and asking questions are important overlooked skills in creating digital products. Lean into the&nbsp;_squish_.

I'm excited to share this new project in my portfolio later this year. But I'm much more excited about the way our product, design, and dev teams are all working together right&nbsp;now.
