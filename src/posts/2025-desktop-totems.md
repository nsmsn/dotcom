[Maxwell is hosting the IndieWeb Carnival](https://www.maxwelljoslyn.com/2025/07/01/1) this month: 

<blockquote>
<p>I'm the host for this month's IndieWeb Carnival, and the theme is totems: items of great personal, spiritual, or religious meaning, which may serve as the emblem or symbol of a group of people.</p>

<p>The IndieWeb itself is a living totem that we indie-website-havers create with every post. What's your totem? What does it mean to you? How did you acquire it: purchase, creation, trade, gifting, theft? Is your totem connected to the Internet, perhaps? Is it something you look at every day?</p>

I've written before about the importance of having a personal _space_. I keep art in my office made by my wife and my kid and some other family, and guitars that were given to me by my parents or owned by them. I keep a lot of stuff on my desk. Some of it is practical for work, like computer stuff, cables and connectors, and headphones. But a lot of it is personal stuff that just means something to me. Here is a brief photographic tour of a few of my totems.

First up is this tiny duck decoy, which my wife acquired at a thrift store or yard sale years ago and gifted me with. Since this totem entered my posession, its always been affixed with a bit of putty to an external monitor at my work-from-home setup.

My wife also surprised me one year with this green utility truck, similar to the model my grandpa drove and rode in during his postwar years as a lineman for New York Telephone. Somewhere I have a black-and-white photo of him in front of his truck, plus a number of other old Bell System items: a beltbuckle, a drink coaster, and grandpa's lifetime member Communications Workers of America union card, etched in metal.

I will probably start collecting baseballs next. This one was sent from a friend who knows I like the Mets. It features Rowdy, the mascot for the AA Binghamton Rumble Ponies.

This is not an officially licensed [energy dome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_dome). This came from someone's 3D printer and was listed for under five bucks on eBay. I also have one in blue.

I have some of my dad's ashes in this "keepsake urn" which is a smaller version of the urn my sister picked out for our dad's memorial in 2021. The teardrop shape always makes me think of a guitar's pick guard, which is kind of fitting for him. _Keepsake urn_ is such a funerary-industrial-complex term, but my mom ordered one of these for each of us, and I'm not going to refuse such an item. This is placed on my windowsill so this little bit of Dad gets to face the Sandia mountains each day. 

The desk itself is also bit of a totem, a thick slab of oak I saved from a gigantic desk my dad kept in his home office when I was growing up. It's gone everywhere with me since I acquired it from him around 2007? 2008? I cut a couple inches off the slab so I could easily fit it in a Jeep Cherokee. It used to gingerly balance on two filing cabinets, but I wised up and  ordered a set of custom metal legs which are easy to install/remove for moving. No photo, since it is currently in an embarassing messy state.

By now it should be apparent I am not a minimalist. Each of these things brings me some pleasure and carries some meaning, and have found a prominent place in the room where I spend a good chunk of my days.
