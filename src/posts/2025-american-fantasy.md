Mike Monteiro, "[How to lose a child](https://buttondown.com/monteiro/archive/how-to-lose-a-child/)":

> We used to call this kind of loss “unimaginable.” But not only has it become imaginable, it’s become so normalized that we’ve decided there’s nothing to be done about it. We lower our heads in sympathy. We blame it on “the culture” as if the culture can’t be changed. We give thoughts and prayers (not to be confused with Thoughts & Prayers™). We write things like this as if they’ll make a difference, or at least make us feel less complicit. (It won’t and we aren’t.) Some of us might even write to our elected officials about it (…which I’m not discouraging). We walk home a little faster than usual because we know (hope) our kid is waiting there for us. We give them an extra long hug for reasons they might not totally understand (…again, not discouraging this.) And ultimately we go back to our lives. Because we can. Because, for now—this time—we can.

In the United States, there is a fantasy—I'm not sure what else to call it at this point, except maybe "delusion"—that allowing anyone to buy a weapon designed to kill as many people as quickly as possible is going to somehow keep us all safe from some kind of (_theoretical of course_) tyrannical government. 

And what does this sacred and protected "freedom" look like? Again and again, it's dead children. In our neighborhoods, classrooms, churches, movie theaters, Walmart stores. In 2020, [firearms surpassed car accidents as the leading cause of death for children and teens](https://usafacts.org/data-projects/child-death) in the U.S. Death by homicide, suicide, or accident. Preventable deaths, I would argue, if we only took the lives of children seriously.

I've been involved with the movement to prevent gun violence for a while. I got involved while I lived in Tennessee, where the state government decided it was a good idea for college and university staff to bring their weapons to work. As bleak as it looks right now, despite the odds stacked against us all, if you live here in the U.S., there are actions you can take. Right now the main calls to action on [everytown.org](https://www.everytown.org/) are to [tell Congress to pass an assault weapons ban](https://act.everytown.org/sign/awb-2023/) and to [oppose the federal concealed carry mandate](https://act.everytown.org/sign/CCM-25/). 

There's other meaningful things you can do, like taking a class on how to [keep guns secured and out of reach for kids](https://besmartforkids.org/). Asking other parents about the weapons they might have in their home is _uncomfortable_. But these are life-saving conversations. Training is available. We need you in this fight. Keep&nbsp;going.
