I recently had a bit of a revelation: Every place I’ve lived for more than one year was featured prominently on _The Simpsons_. This might be inevitable given that this is one of the longest-running shows on television. Anyway, here are the locations:

1. **Utica, New York**: Pretty darn close to my stomping grounds in Madison and Oneida Counties. Superintendent Chalmers reveals he’s from there, although he never heard the phrase “steamed hams” before (probably because it is more of an Albany expression). From the episode "[22 Short Films About Springfield](https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Steamed_Hams)."

2. **Grand Canyon**: So I didn’t live at the Grand Canyon proper, but in nearby Flagstaff, Arizona. I had to look this up on the [Simpsons wiki](https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Grand_Canyon), but the Canyon was in both _The Simpsons Movie_ and as a vacation destination for the Simpson and Flanders families in the 27th season.

3. **Knoxville, Tennessee**: Thanks to the episode “[Bart on the Road](https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Bart_on_the_Road)” we all know the Sunsphere is full of wigs.

4. **Albuquerque, New Mexico**: Where the Springfield Isotopes were about to be relocated before Homer staged his hunger strike in “[Hungry Hungry Homer](https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Hungry,_Hungry_Homer)”

Have The Simpsons visited or referenced your hometown? I’d love to know.
