A while ago I signed up to host June‚Äôs [IndieWeb Carnival](https://indieweb.org/IndieWeb_Carnival) and chose the topic ‚Äúpersonal style‚Äù. Earlier this year, Pablo hosted a [Carnival on ‚Äúself-expression‚Äù](https://lifeofpablo.com/blog/self-expression-indieweb-carnival-march-2025) and I panicked a bit... maybe my theme was too similar?

A couple days ago, a new theme came to mind: "**Take Two**."

Ever wish for a do-over? "Take two!" (or three, four, etc.) might be shouted by a film director or audio engineer looking to get a somewhat different outcome from a group of actors or musical performers. Would you like a second shot at something that didn't land? 

Or maybe you've been blogging for a long time and there's old stuff on your blog you may no longer fully agree with anymore. Would you write an update to that older post?

Also, [time travel is a popular trope](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravelTropes) in books, film, and television. I don't know if that has been explored in an IndieWeb Carnival before. Here's an opportunity to revisit the past: not to relive it (or repeat it), but to do something... interesting with it.

I invite you to think about the phrase "take two" and use your personal site to publish a&nbsp;response.

## Participating in this month's Carnival

I look forward to hearing from you&mdash;**especially if you've never done one of these before**&mdash;and how you choose to interpret this theme. If you're stuck, here's some prompts to get you going:

- What is an old "take" you no longer have, or can no longer endorse?
- If there was a moment in time you could travel back to, would you change the course of history if you had the opportunity to act?
- Do you dabble in any "retro" technologies? What's an old interface or vintage hardware you'd like to resurrect for 2025?
- Maybe you missed out on and want to revisit one of the previous IndieWeb Carnival [themes](https://indieweb.org/IndieWeb_Carnival#List_Of_Past_IndieWeb_Carnivals_&_Hosts)?
- Anything else you‚Äôd like to share!

Email me a link to your entry published on your personal website: <a href="mailto:nick@nicksimson.com">nick@nicksimson.com</a>. I also have a [contact form](/contact.html) you can use. You may also reply to me on [Mastodon](https://social.lol/@nsmsn/114606170114272686) or [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/nicksimson.com/post/3lqjfnh76xk2x), if you prefer. Please note: **I do not currently have comments or [webmentions](https://indieweb.org/Webmention) enabled** on my site, so I can't receive&nbsp;those.

Since this is an IndieWeb community activity, please follow the [Code of Conduct](https://indieweb.org/code-of-conduct). I will attempt to keep this post updated with links to each submission as I get them through June, and I'll be back around July 1 with a roundup post of my&nbsp;own.
