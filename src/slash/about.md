# About

<img src="/img/note-images/2025-whitesands-kite-02.jpg" alt="a man flies a kite against a bright blue sky and white sand dunes" width="420" height="358">

My name is Nick, short for *Nicholas* which means “[victory of the people](https://www.behindthename.com/name/nicholas).”

I’m a graphic and interaction designer, and my favorite medium to work with is the World Wide Web. I have been at this design thing professionally for more than 15 years, with most of that time spent working in-house with higher education institutions. Today I’m a user interface (UI) designer at a nonprofit member association in Washington, DC.

Through my design practice I’ve been lucky to work with some wonderful artists, musicians, scientists, and writers. I spent a long time as a generalist and thrive on learning new things.

See what I’m up to [now](/now.html).

I’m married to [Eleanor](https://eleanoraldrich.com), who makes paintings. We live in New Mexico with our preschooler and a [small dog](/tags/zelda.html).
