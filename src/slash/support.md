# Support this site

This website is a hobby, and Iâ€™m not expecting to replace my day job or income by blogging. That said, it does cost a little money to run a website. My main expenses are web/email hosting each month and domain renewal costs each&nbsp;year.

If you like what Iâ€™m doing and want to support my blogging habit, there are a couple ways you can show your&nbsp;support:

<ul>
    <li>ðŸ†• <a href="https://ko-fi.com/summary/1716455c-164b-4a91-9761-7335be8d0b59">Join the Chaos Club for $1 a month</a> and get your name (and hyperlink) featured on this page.</li>
    <li><a href="https://ko-fi.com/nsmsn">Buy me a coffee</a>. This website is powered by caffeine, and more coffee is always appreciated.</li>
    <li><a href="https://bookshop.org/shop/nsmsn">Buy a book from me</a>. Iâ€™m an affiliate of Bookshop.org and any purchases made using my links will earn me (and bookstores!) a small commission.</li>
    <li>Share one of my posts! Although few of us are paid in links, the humble hyperlink is still the beating heart of the world wide&nbsp;web.</li>
</ul>
