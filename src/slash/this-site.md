# How this site works

My website is a labor of love. I registered the domain <code>nicksimson.com</code> in February 2008 and renew it every year as a small gift to myself.

I treat my site as a [commonplace book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonplace_book), a term I stumbled upon in 2021. I have become a big fan of writing frequent, shorter [notes](/notes/index.html), which I refer to in my daily life and work, and often feed into my longer form writing, which I call [posts](/posts/index.html).

My site has a few different [feeds](/feeds.html), in RSS and JSON formats. I also use a system of [tags](/tags/index.html) to organize the posts and notes. For example, entries tagged with <a class="tagged-item" href="/tags/this-site.html">This site</a> document countless updates I've made to the website over the years.

I keep many static pages serving various purposes. I try to keep a sprawling index of [all pages and directories](/all.html), and try to keep these evergreen/perennial pages up to date.

ðŸš§ **Everything on this site is under construction** right now...so please pardon the dust. I am constantly making changes, and will probably never be 100% happy with my CSS.

## Colophon

Built with [Web Origami](https://weborigami.org/), a programming language and static site generator that runs on NodeJS. Most of the content here is written as [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) files rendered to HTML on each build. The site is [versioned on GitHub](https://github.com/nsmsn/dotcom) and deploys to [Netlify](https://netlify.com), which hosts the&nbsp;site.

The [search functionality](/search.html) is powered by [Pagefind](https://pagefind.app/), a fully static search library built with JavaScript. 

The primary typeface is [Hanken Grotesk](https://hanken.co/products/hanken-grotesk), with <code>code samples</code> set in TK, and supporting text set in [Server Mono](https://blazetype.eu/case-studies/server-mono).

**This website does not track you.** While some pages may contain third-party code for additional functionality, to my best knowledge and efforts there are **no cookies** anywhere on this website.
